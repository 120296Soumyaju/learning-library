# Login to Oracle Cloud #

## Introduction

Free Tier:  After you sign up for the free Oracle Cloud promotion or sign up for a paid account, youâ€™ll get a welcome email. The email provides you with your cloud account details and sign in credentials.

Oracle Cloud Paid Account:  When your tenancy is provisioned, Oracle sends an email to the default administrator at your company with the sign-in credentials and URL. This administrator can then create a user for each person who needs access to the Oracle Cloud. Check your email or contact your administrator for your credentials and account name.
