# Login to Oracle Cloud - SSWorkshop #

## Introduction
SSWorkshop:  After you sign up for a self-service workshop, youâ€™ll get two emails.  Check your spam and junk folders or contact your instructor.
- *Email 1:  Verify Email Request* - this contains the URL to verify that your email is a valid one for this tenancy
- *Email 2: SSWorkshop Account Created* - This contains important information needed to complete your workshop along with your username, password and a link to the lab.



1.  Open up Email 1:  Verify Email Request from Oracle Cloud.  Click on the **Sign In to Oracle Cloud** link.

3. You will then be taken to a screen to change your password.  Choose a new password that you can remember and click **Sign In** (make sure you are using an approved browser.  IE is not supported)

4. Once you successfully login, you will be presented with the Oracle Cloud homepage. (NOTE: If you get an *Email Activation Unsuccessful* message, check to see if you can still access the cloud by looking for the hamburger menu to the left).

5.  In Email 2, you were also assigned a region.  Click in the upper right hand corner and set your Region appropriately.   (*NOTE:  Setting the region is important, your network is region specific.  If you choose a different region that does not match your subnet, you will get an error on environment creation*)
