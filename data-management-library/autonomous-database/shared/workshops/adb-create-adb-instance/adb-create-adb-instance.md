# Provisioning Autonomous Database (ADW and ATP)


## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to get started using the Oracle Autonomous Database (Autonomous Data Warehouse [ADW] and Autonomous Transaction Processing [ATP]) on Oracle Cloud. You will provision a new ADW instance and connect to the database using Oracle SQL Developer Web.

*Note: While this lab uses ADW, the steps are identical for creating and connecting to an ATP database.*

### Objectives

-   Learn how to provision a new Autonomous Data Warehouse

### Required Artifacts

The following lab requires an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/" target="\_blank">Oracle Cloud account</a>. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, a Free Tier account, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.

### Lab Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have already completed the [Log in to Oracle Cloud] (?lab=lab-1-login-oracle-cloud) lab seen in the menu on the right.  In this lab you will be provisioning an ADB database instance using the cloud console.

### Video Preview

Watch a video demonstration of provisioning a new autonomous data warehouse:

## STEP 2: Creating the ADB instance

1. Click **Create Autonomous Database** to start the instance creation process.

2.  This brings up the __Create Autonomous Database__ screen where you will specify the configuration of the instance.
3. Provide basic information for the autonomous database:

    - __Choose a compartment__ - Select a compartment for the database from the drop-down list.
    - __Display Name__ - Enter a memorable name for the database for display purposes. For this lab, use __ADW Finance Mart__.
    - __Database Name__ - Use letters and numbers only, starting with a letter. Maximum length is 14 characters. (Underscores not initially supported.) For this lab, use __ADWFINANCE__.

4. Choose a workload type. Select the workload type for your database from the choices:

    - __Data Warehouse__ - For this lab, choose __Data Warehouse__ as the workload type.
    - __Transaction Processing__ - Alternately, you could have chosen Transaction Processing as the workload type.

5. Choose a deployment type. Select the deployment type for your database from the choices:

    - __Shared Infrastructure__ - For this lab, choose __Shared Infrastructure__ as the deployment type.
    - __Dedicated Infrastructure__ - Alternately, you could have chosen Dedicated Infrastructure as the workload type.

6. Configure the database:

    - __Always Free__ - For this lab, you can select this option to create an always free autonomous database, or not select this option and create a database using your paid subscription. An always free database comes with 1 CPU and 20 GB of storage.
    - __Choose database version__ - Select a database version from the available versions.
    - __OCPU count__ - Number of CPUs for your service. For this lab, specify __2 CPUs__. Or, if you choose an always free database, it comes with 1 CPU.
    - __Storage (TB)__ - Select your storage capacity in terabytes. For this lab, specify __1 TB__ of storage. Or, if you choose an always free database, it comes with 20 GB of storage.
    - __Auto Scaling__ - For this lab, __deselect__ auto scaling.
    - __New Database Preview__ - If a checkbox is available to preview a new database version, do __not__ select it.

7. Create administrator credentials:

    - __Password and Confirm Password__ - Specify the password for ADMIN user of the service instance. The password must meet the following requirements:
    - The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character.
    - The password cannot contain the username.
    - The password cannot contain the double quote (") character.
    - The password must be different from the last 4 passwords used.
    - The password must not be the same password that is set less than 24 hours ago.
    - Re-enter the password to confirm it. Make a note of this password.

8. Choose network access:
    - For this lab, accept the default, "Allow secure access from everywhere".
    - If you want a private endpoint, to allow traffic only from the VCN you specify - where access to the database from all public IPs or VCNs is blocked, then select "Virtual cloud network" in the Choose network access area.
    - You can control and restrict access to your Autonomous Database by setting network access control lists (ACLs). You can select from 4 IP notation types: IP Address, CIDR Block, Virtual Cloud Network, Virtual Cloud Network OCID).

9. Choose a license type. For this lab, choose __License Included__. The two license types are:

    - __Bring Your Own License (BYOL)__ - Select this type when your organization has existing database licenses.
    - __License Included__ - Select this type when you want to subscribe to new database software licenses and the database cloud service.

10. Click __Create Autonomous Database__.

11.  Your instance will begin provisioning. In a few minutes the state will turn from Provisioning to Available. At this point, your Autonomous Data Warehouse database is ready to use! Have a look at your instance's details here including its name, database version, CPU count and storage size.
