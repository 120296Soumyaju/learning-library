# Loading Data into an Autonomous Database Instance using SQL Developer Web

## Introduction

In this lab, you will upload files to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Object Storage, create sample tables, load data into them from files on the OCI Object Storage, and troubleshoot data loads with errors.

You can load data into your new autonomous database (Autonomous Data Warehouse [ADW] or Autonomous Transaction Processing [ATP]) using Oracle Database tools, and Oracle and 3rd party data integration tools. You can load data:

+ from files local to your client computer, or
+ from files stored in a cloud-based object store

For the fastest data loading experience Oracle recommends uploading the source files to a cloud-based object store, such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage, before loading the data into your ADW or ATP database.

To load data from files in the cloud into your autonomous database, use the new PL/SQL `DBMS_CLOUD` package. The `DBMS_CLOUD` package supports loading data files from the following Cloud sources: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Classic, Amazon AWS S3, and Microsoft Azure Object Store.

This lab shows how to load data from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage using two of the procedures in the `DBMS_CLOUD` package:

+ **create_credential**: Stores the object store credentials in your Autonomous Data Warehouse schema.
    + You will use this procedure to create object store credentials in your ADW admin schema.
+ **copy_data**: Loads the specified source file to a table. The table must already exist in ADW.
    + You will use this procedure to load tables in your admin schema with data from data files staged in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage cloud service.

**Note:** While this lab uses ADW, the steps are identical for loading data into an ATP database.

### More Information
For more information about loading data, see the documentation [Loading Data from Files in the Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud&id=CSWHU-GUID-07900054-CB65-490A-AF3C-39EF45505802).


### Objectives

-   Learn how to use SQL Developer Web to load data into an autonomous database table
-   Learn how to upload files to the OCI Object Storage
-   Learn how to define object store credentials for your autonomous database
-   Learn how to create tables in your database
-   Learn how to load data from the Object Store
-   Learn how to troubleshoot data loads

### Required Artifacts

-   The following lab requires an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/" target="\_blank"> Oracle Cloud account</a>. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.

In Steps 1 to 3, you will create one ADW table, CHANNELS_LOCAL, and load it with sample data from your local file system. In the remaining steps, you will create several ADW tables and load them with sample data that you stage to an OCI Object Store.

### Lab Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the [Login to Oracle Cloud] (?lab=lab-1-login-oracle-cloud) and [Provision ADB] (?lab=lab-2-provision-adb) labs seen in the menu on the right.


## STEP 1: Download Sample Data and Create Local Table

1. For this step, you will download a .csv file to your local computer, then use it to populate the CHANNELS_LOCAL table that you will create in your ADW database in the next step.  Click <a href="./files/channels.csv" target="\_blank">here</a> to download the sample channels.csv file, saving it to a directory on your local computer.

2. In your autonomous database's details page, click the **Tools** tab. Click **Open SQL Developer Web**.

3. To define the CHANNELS_LOCAL table, click <a href="./files/define_channels_local_table.txt" target="\_blank">here</a> to copy or download the table creation code snippet. Then paste it into the SQL Developer Web worksheet and click the **Run Script** button to run it.

## STEP 2: Load Local Data Using SQL Developer Web

1. In the Navigator, **right-click** your new CHANNELS_LOCAL table. You might need to refresh the Navigator to see the new table. In the menu, select **Data loading â†’ Upload Data...**:

2. The Data Import Wizard is started. Perform the following:

    -   Click **Select files** to select the file for data uploading.

    -   Click the browse button and navigate to the channels.csv file that you downloaded in Step 1.

3. After you select the file, the wizard provides a **Data preview** step. You can click the **Show/Hide options** button to perform actions including skipping rows and limiting rows to upload. Use the horizontal toolbar to check the data.

4. When you are satisfied with the file's data, click **NEXT**.

<!--When newline is fixed ![](./images/snap0014654.jpg " ")-->

  *Note - If your source .csv file has delimiters other than commas between words, or line delimiters other than new-line characters, you will need to use SQL Developer for now, rather than SQL Developer Web.*

5. In Step 2 of the Import Wizard, **Column mapping**, you can change the source-to-target column mappings. For this exercise, leave them as default and click **NEXT**.

6.  The final step of the Import Wizard, **Review**, reflects all of the choices you made in the Wizard. Click **FINISH** to load the data into your newly created table *CHANNELS_LOCAL*. If you don't see it in your object tree under Tables, right click on Tables and hit refresh.

7. Click **OK** to confirm the import. Depending on the size of the data file you are importing, the import may take some time.
