## Introduction ##
Oracle Autonomous Database is a family of self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing cloud services. It’s the world’s first autonomous database, and it redefines database management by using machine learning and automation to eliminate human labor, human error, and manual tuning, reducing cost and complexity and ensuring higher reliability, security, and more operational efficiency. Autonomous Database supports a complex mix of high-performance transactions, including reporting, batch, Internet of Things (IoT), and machine learning in a single database. This simplifies application development and deployment and enables real-time analytics, personalization, and fraud detection.

Oracle Autonomous Database is available exclusively from Oracle and is offered in two configurations, both of which are optimized to meet the specialized requirements for online transaction processing and data warehousing. Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing Service allows much simpler application development and deployment for enabling real-time analytics, personalization, and fraud detection. Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse delivers unprecedented reliability, performance, and highly elastic data management, enabling data warehouse deployment in seconds. Both Autonomous Transaction Processing and Autonomous Data Warehouse are available in Shared Infrastructure and Dedicated forms—the Shared Infrastructure service focuses on simplicity and elasticity, while the Dedicated service provides customers with a customizable private database cloud.
