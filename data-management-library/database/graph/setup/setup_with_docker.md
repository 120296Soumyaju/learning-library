## Overview

Let's load graph data from files before setting up database.

![](./images/load_data.jpg)

## Step 1: Launch Graph Server

### Clone this Repository
    $ <copy>git clone https://github.com/ryotayamanaka/oracle-pg.git</copy>

### Download and Extract Packages
Go to the following pages and download the packages.

- [Oracle Graph Server and Client 20.1](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/spatialandgraph/property-graph-features/graph-server-and-client/graph-server-and-client-downloads.html)
- [Apache Groovy 2.4.18](https://dl.bintray.com/groovy/maven/apache-groovy-binary-2.4.18.zip)

Put the following files into `oracle-pg/docker/tmp/`

- oracle-graph-20.1.0.x86_64.rpm
- oracle-graph-zeppelin-interpreter-20.1.0.zip
- apache-groovy-binary-2.4.18.zip
 
Run the following script to extract the packages:

```
$ <copy>cd oracle-pg/docker/tmp/</copy>
$ <copy>sh extract.sh</copy>
```

### Start Containers
Build and pull images, create containers, and start them.

```
$ <copy>cd oracle-pg/docker/</copy>
$ <copy>docker-compose up -d</copy>
```

This takes some time. To check the progress, see **Appendix 1**.

Access Graph Visualization.

 - [http://localhost:7007/ui/](http://localhost:7007/ui/)

Access Zeppelin and start querying and analyzing graphs, e.g. [Customer 360 Analysis](../customer_360_analysis/customer_360_analysis.md).

- [http://localhost:8080/#/](http://localhost:8080/#/)

To stop, restart, or remove the containers, see **Appendix 2**.

### Appendix 1
View the contaners' log files to check the progress of creating and starting them.

```
$ <copy>cd oracle-pg/docker/ ;</copy>
$ <copy>docker-compose logs -f</copy>
```

`Ctl+C` to quit.

### Appendix 2
To start, stop, or restart the containers.

```
$ <copy>cd oracle-pg/docker/ ;</copy>
$ <copy>docker-compose start|stop|restart</copy>
```

To remove the docker containers.

```
$ <copy>cd oracle-pg/docker/ ;</copy>
$ <copy>docker-compose down</copy>
```

## Step 2: Configure database on Docker

In this tutorial, we will create a docker container for Oracle Database as a backend storage of graphs.
![](./images/build_docker.jpg)

### Build Docker Image
Clone `docker-images` repository.

```
$ <copy>git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git</copy>
```

Download Oracle Database.

[Oracle Database 19.3.0 for Linux x86-64 (ZIP)](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/oracle-database-software-downloads.html)

Put `LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip` under:

- `docker-images/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles/19.3.0/`

Build the image.

```
$ <copy>cd docker-images/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles/ ;</copy>
$ <copy>bash buildDockerImage.sh -v 19.3.0 -e </copy>
```

### Start Containers

Start the containers for **Oracle Database** only.

```
$ <copy>cd oracle-pg/docker/ ;</copy>
$ <copy>docker-compose -f docker-compose-rdbms.yml up -d oracle-db </copy>
```

This step takes time becuase it starts the container and then builds the databse itself. View the container's log to track progress.  **Appendix 1**.

### Configure Oracle Database

Connect to the Oracle Database server.

```    
$ <copy>docker exec -it oracle-db sqlplus sys/Welcome1@localhost:1521/orclpdb1 as sysdba</copy>
```

Set max\_string\_size running max\_string\_size.sql.

```
SQL> <copy>@/home/oracle/scripts/max_string_size.sql</copy>

...

NAME              TYPE        VALUE
----------------- ----------- ---------
max_string_size   string      EXTENDED
```

Next step is to create a graph in the database.

### Load Table Data

Connect to the database as "sys" user, and create a user, "customer_360".

```
$ <copy> docker exec -it oracle-db sqlplus sys/Welcome1@localhost:1521/orclpdb1 as sysdba</copy>
```

```
SQL> <copy>@/graphs/customer_360/create_user.sql<copy>
SQL> EXIT
```

Connect to the database as the "customer_360" user, and create tables.

```
$ <copy>docker exec -it oracle-db sqlplus customer_360/Welcome1@localhost:1521/orclpdb1</copy>
```

```
SQL> <copy>@/graphs/customer_360/create_tables.sql</copy>
SQL> EXIT
```

### Create Property Graph

The following DDL creates a property graph (i.e. node and edge tables) from the relational table data.

![](./images/create_graph.jpg)

[create_pg.pgql](.setup/files/graphs/customer_360/create_pg.pgql)


```
CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH customer_360
  VERTEX TABLES (
    customer
      LABEL "Customer"
      PROPERTIES (
        type AS "type"
      , name AS "name"
      , age AS "age"
      , location AS "location"
      , gender AS "gender"
      , student AS "student"
      )
  , account
      LABEL "Account"
      PROPERTIES (
        type AS "type"
      , account_no AS "account_no"
      , balance AS "balance"
      )
  , merchant
      LABEL "Merchant"
      PROPERTIES (
        type AS "type"
      , name AS "name"
      )
  )
  EDGE TABLES (
    owned_by
      SOURCE KEY(from_id) REFERENCES account
      DESTINATION KEY(to_id) REFERENCES customer
      LABEL "owned_by"
      PROPERTIES (
        since AS "since"
      )
  , parent_of
      SOURCE KEY(from_id) REFERENCES customer
      DESTINATION KEY(to_id) REFERENCES customer
      LABEL "parent_of"
  , purchased
      SOURCE KEY(from_id) REFERENCES account
      DESTINATION KEY(to_id) REFERENCES merchant
      LABEL "purchased"
      PROPERTIES (
        amount AS "amount"
      )
  , transfer
      SOURCE KEY(from_id) REFERENCES account
      DESTINATION KEY(to_id) REFERENCES account
      LABEL "transfer"
      PROPERTIES (
        amount AS "amount"
      , date AS "date"
      )
  )
```
Note: The file is part of the repository under the graphs/customer_360/ directory. So if your REPOR_HOME is  /gitrepos/oracle-pg then the file's path is /gitrepos/oracle-pg/graphs/customer_360/create_pg.pgql. You will need the correct file path below.

Using Graph Client, connect to Oracle Database and run the DDL above.

```
$ <copy>docker exec -it graph-client opg-rdbms-jshell</copy>
```

Once JShell is running and you see the lines 
```
Oracle Graph Server Shell 20.1.0
PGX server version: 19.4.0 type: SM
PGX server API version: 3.6.0
PGQL version: 1.2
Variables instance, session, and analyst ready to use.
opg-rdbms-jshell> 
```

Enter the following code to:  
- Specify the JDBC connection to the database
- Open a Connection
- Set a required parameter for PGQL operation
- Create a PgqlConnection
- Read, prepare, and execute the CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH statement

```
<copy>
var jdbcUrl = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-db:1521/orclpdb1";
var conn = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, "customer_360", "Welcome1");
conn.setAutoCommit(false);
var pgql = PgqlConnection.getConnection(conn);
pgql.prepareStatement(Files.readString(Paths.get("{$REPO_HOME}/graphs/customer_360/create_pg.pgql"))).execute(); 
</copy>
```

Note: The execute() above will return `false` on completion since the first result is not a ResultSet. 

Exit Graph Client. See also **Appendix 2**.
```
\exit
```
### Loading Configuration

The following configuration files determine the graph server startup settings and optionally the graphs that are pre-loaded. 

The pgx-rdbms.conf file under {$REPO_HOME}/docker/conf/ specifies which graph to pre-load.

The configuration of the graph itself, i.e. how and what to load, is in the JFON file rdbms.json under {$REPO_HOME}/graphs/customer_360/.

![](./images/load_conf.jpg)

`pgx-rdbms.conf`

```
$ oracle-pg/docker/conf/pgx-rdbms.conf
"preload_graphs": [
  {"path": "/graphs/customer_360/rdbms.json", "name": "Customer360_db"},
```

`rdbms.json`

```
{
  "format":"pg",
  "db_engine":"rdbms",
  "jdbc_url":"jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-db:1521/orclpdb1",
  "username":"customer_360",
  "keystore_alias":"database1",
  "max_num_connections":8,
  "name":"customer_360",
  "vertex_props": [
    {"name":"type", "type":"string"},
    {"name":"name", "type":"string"},
    {"name":"age", "type":"integer"},
    {"name":"location", "type":"string"},
    {"name":"gender", "type":"string"},
    {"name":"student", "type":"string"},
    {"name":"account_no", "type":"string"},
    {"name":"balance", "type":"integer"}
  ],
  "edge_props": [
    {"name":"since", "type":"string"},
    {"name":"amount", "type":"integer"},
    {"name":"date", "type":"string"}
  ],
  "loading":{
    "load_edge_label":true
  }
}
```

Note that edge labels are also loaded.

See also **Appendix 3**.

Start Graph Server
Run Docker containers for Graph Server, Graph Client, and Zeppelin.

    $ <copy>cd oracle-pg/docker/ ;</copy>
    $ <copy>docker-compose -f docker-compose-rdbms.yml restart</copy>

See also **Appendix 4**.

Open Graph Visualization and check if this graph is successfully loaded.

[http://localhost:7007/ui/](http://localhost:7007/ui/)

Open Zeppelin and try running "Customer 360" analytics example.

[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

### Appendix 1

You will get this error when you try to connect before the database is created.

```
$ <copy>docker exec -it oracle-db sqlplus sys/Welcome1@localhost:1521/orclpdb1 as sysdba</copy>
...
ORA-12514: TNS:listener does not currently know of service requested in connect
```

To check the progress, see logs.

```
$ cd oracle-pg/docker/
$ <copy>docker-compose -f docker-compose-rdbms.yml logs -f oracle-db</copy>
```

`Ctl+C` to quit.

### Appendix 2

You can check the graph by executing the following code aqnd query (= PGQL on RDBMS) in the JShell.  
How many nodes are in the newly created property graph?

Start a JShell. Then check which graph is loaded. Then query it.

```
<copy>docker exec -it graph-client opg-rdbms-jshell -b http://graph-server:7007</copy>
```

Enter the following code in JShell.
```
<copy>
Consumer<String> query = q -> {
    try(var s = pgql.prepareStatement(q)) {
      s.execute();
      s.getResultSet().print();
    } catch(Exception e) {
      throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
  }

query.accept("select count(v) from Customer360-PG match (v)");
</copy>
+----------+
| count(v) |
+----------+
| 8        |
+----------+
```

### Appendix 3

To test the database graph loading configuration (i.e. rdbms.json) start JShell and execute the code below.

```
$ <copy>docker exec -it graph-client opg-rdbms-jshell -b http://graph-server:7007</copy>
var graph = session.readGraphWithProperties("/graphs/customer_360/rdbms.json")
```


### Appendix 4

Start, stop, or restart the containers.

```
$ cd oracle-pg/docker/
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-rdbms.yml start|stop|restart
```

Stop the containers and remove them.

```
$ cd oracle-pg/docker/
$ <copy>docker-compose -f docker-compose-rdbms.yml down</copy>
```
