# Use Case: Customer 360 analysis #

This example shows how integrating multiple datasets, using a graph, facilitates additional analytics can lead to new insights. We will use three small datasets for illustrative purposes. The first contains accounts and account  owners. The second is purchases by the people who own those accounts. The third is transactions between these accounts.

The combined dataset is then used to perform the following common graph query and analyses: pattern matching, detection of cycles, finding important nodes, community detection, and recommendation.
