# Welcome to Oracle Database Multitenant Content

## Oracle Multitenant

Oracle Multitenant is the architecture for the next-generation database cloud. It delivers isolation, agility and economies of scale. A multitenant container database can hold many pluggable databases. An existing database can simply be adopted with no application changes required. Oracle Multitenant fully complements other options, including Oracle Real Application Clusters and Oracle Active Data Guard.  Click on one of our workshops below to access the content.
