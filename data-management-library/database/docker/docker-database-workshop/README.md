# Create Oracle Database in a Docker Container on Oracle Cloud
## Introduction

Welcome to the Oracle Database Docker Workshop. Using Docker build files for Oracle Database provided on Github, you can containerize an application - in this case, an instance of Oracle Database. This workshop will walk you through the following tasks:

- Sign up for an Oracle Free Trial account and sign in to your account
- Create a set of SSH keys
- Create a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) instance
- Create an Oracle Cloud Compute instance
- Set up Docker on the Cloud Compute instance
- Build an Oracle Database Docker image
- Start the Oracle Database in a Docker container
- Add an Ingress rule to the VCN
- Connect to the Database in the container

Each of the labs are 5 -10 minutes in length, so you'll be up and running in no time.
