## Introduction
-------------------
This lab will show you how to login to the cloud and setup a compute instance running the Oracle 19c database.   In this lab, you will create an OCI Compute instance using the [Oracle Database](https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/listing/47726045) image in the Oracle Cloud Marketplace. 

The Oracle Cloud Marketplace is an online store dedicated to marketing cloud business apps and professional services offered by Oracle and it's cloud partners. 

The automation is driven by the same framework that powers the decade long Oracle VM Templates for Oracle Database which have thousands of downloads and customers using it.

Automatically deploy a fully functional Database environment by leveraging a simple cloud-config script.  The deployment allows for basic customization of the environment, further configurations, like adding extra disks and NICs, is possible post-deployment.


## Lab Assumptions
------------------- 
- For PM sponsored roadshows, each participant has been provided an account on the c4u03 tenancy and the VCN has been created.
- For self service, the user has access to a cloud account or free-tier account


## Section 1-Login to the Oracle Cloud 
-------------------
1.  From any browser go to www.oracle.com to access the Oracle Cloud.

    ![](img/login-screen.png)

2. Click the icon in the upper right corner.  Click on **Sign in to Cloud** at the bottom of the drop down.  *NOTE:  Do NOT click the Sign-In button, this will take you to Single Sign-On, not the Oracle Cloud*

    ![](img/signup.png)    

3. Enter your **Cloud Account Name**.  If you are in a PM sponsored roadshow, this will be provided by the PM team.  Otherwise, use your free-tier tenancy name or oracle cloud account. 

    ![](img/login-tenancy.png)  

4.  If your username/password was provided follow step 4a.  If your password leverages single sign on, proceed to step 4b.

    4A. USERNAME/PASSWORD
    
    Enter your **Username** and **Password** in the input fields and click **Sign In**.

    ![](img/cloud-login.png) 

    **NOTE**: You will likely be prompted to change the temporary password listed in the welcome email. In that case, enter the new password in the password field.

    4B. SINGLE SIGN ON
    
    Select the **Sign in with Oracle SSO** link and enter your SSO credentials.

5. Once you successfully login, you will be presented with the Oracle Cloud homepage.

## Section 2-Create an SSH key pair
-------------------
### MAC Users ###
1.  Open up a terminal and type the following commands.  When prompted for a passphrase click **enter**. *Do not enter a passphrase*.
     ````
    cd ~
    cd .ssh
    ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f optionskey
    ````

    ![](img/sshkeygen.png) 

3.  Inspect your .ssh directory.  You should see two files.  optionskey and optionskey.pub.  Copy the contents of the pub file `optionskey.pub` into notepad.  Your key file should be one line. You will need this to access your instance in Section 5.  

    ````
    ls -l .ssh
    more optionskey.pub
    ````
    ![](img/optionskey.png) 



### For Windows: Using GitBash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) ### 

1. Open the terminal tool of your choice
1. Type ssh-keygen -f optionskey at the prompt.
1. Press enter to accept default values
1. Do not assign a password for this exercise. (note you should always assign an SSH key password in production)
1. Type cat ~/.ssh/optionskey.pub to retrieve your public key. Save it for future use.



### For Windows: Using PuttyGen ### 

1. Open PuttyGen
1. Click the [Generate] button

    ![](img/puttygen-generate.jpg) 
1. Move your mouse around the screen randomly until the progress bar reaches 100%
1. Click the [Save private key] button. Name the file `options`.  This file will not have an extension.

    ![](img/puttygen-saveprivatekey.jpg) 
1. Save the public key (displayed in the text field) by copying it to the clipboard and saving it manually to a new text file. Name the file id_rsa.pub

1. Note: Sometimes PuttyGen does not save the public key in the correct format. The text string displayed in the window is correct so we just copy/paste.

## Section 3-Download Marketplace initialization zip and Script Zip File
-------------------
1.  Click  [here](https://community.oracle.com/servlet/JiveServlet/download/1031489-6-462822/oci-db-app-script-examples.zip) to download the marketplace initialization zip file.

2.  Save it to your downloads folder

3.  Unzip the folder and locate the StandardIO-db.cloud-init file. You will need this later when you create your compute instance.

  ![](img/db-marketplace.png)

4. Click [here]() to download the scripts.zip file.  You will ftp this file to your newly created compute instance later in this lab.

## Section 6-Setup OCI CLI and Prep for Labs
-------------------
Now that you have your instance, once you are able to ssh in, you will set up the OCI Command Line interface.
1.  Open up a terminal (MAC) or cygwin emulator as the opc user

    ````
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/optionskey opc@<Your Compute Instance Public IP Address>
    ````

2.  Download the Oracle Cloud CLI install script.  

    ````
    bash -c "$(curl –L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/oci-cli/master/scripts/install/install.sh)"
    ````
    ![](img/cli-install.png) 

3.  Accept all the defaults.  This will install packages like python, configparser, etc.  Do not install any additional scripts.  Enter **Y** to update your $PATH and enable shell/tab completion.

    ![](img/cli-install-2.png) 

    ![](img/cli-install-3.png) 

4.  You will be prompted at the end to run an exec command to restart your shell. Do that now.
    ````
    exec -l $SHELL
    ````
4.  Once you verify installation is successful, verify the install by running the oci command with the -v option.  This will tell you the version of oci installed (2.6.10 and later)

    ````
    oci -v
    ````
4.  Now that the binaries are complete.  You will need to provide your tenancy id and user id.  Go back to your browswer and click on the hamburger menu.
    ![](img/cloud-homepage.png) 

5.  Click **Administration** -> **Tenancy** Details

    ![](img/tenancy-details.png) 

6.  Click **Show** to show the full tenancy id.  This is the unique identifier for the tenancy you are working in.  Click **Copy** and copy that to your notepad.

    ![](img/tenancy-details-2.png)  

7.  Repeat the same steps for your user.  To locate your user details go to Identity-> Users.  Note the region in which you are working (upper left corner)

    ![](img/user-details.png) 

8.  Go back to your terminal window and run the oci setup commands to complete configuration.  Accept the default location when prompted.  Enter **Y** to generate an RSA key pair (no passphrase needed).

    ````
    oci setup config
    ````
    - Location for your config: *Press enter*
    - User OCID:  Paste your OCI ID from the previous step
    - Tenancy OCID:  Paste your tenancy ID from the previous step
    - Enter a region:  Find your region in your browser in the top right
    - Generate a new RSA Key Pair:  Y
    - Press enter for the last 3 questions accepting the defaults

     **BE SURE TO PASTE THE CORRECT VALUES OR SETUP WILL NOT WORK**

    ![](img/oci-setup-config.png) 

9. Go to the hidden .oci directory and examime the public key file and the config file.

    ````
    cd /home/opc/.oci
    more config
    more /home/opc/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
    ````
    ![](img/config.png) 

    ![](img/pem.png) 

10.  Now that you have installed cli and configured it, you need to add an API key to your user profile.  Go back to your browswer and click the user icon (top Rrght of your browswer) and click **User Settings**. Click **API Keys** and **Add Public Key**.

  ![](img/usersettings.png) 

  ![](img/addapikeys-1.png) 

  ![](img/addapikeys.png) 

  ![](img/apikey.png) 

10. Paste the content of oci_api_key_public.pem copied earlier and click Add.A new finger print will be generated. Switch to the SSH terminal session and type:

    ````
    more /home/opc/.oci/config
    ````

    Compare the fingerprint in the output of config file to the one in OCI console window and make sure they match.

10.  Now let's test.  Enter the following command:
````
oci iam availability-domain list
````
    
   ![](img/clilistdomain.png) 

10.  Congrats! You have command line access to your newly created instance!  Let's  download the files you will need for these labs from object storage.
````
cd /home/opc/
oci os object list -bn DBOptions
oci os object bulk-download -bn DBOptions --download-dir /home/opc
````
    
![](img/ssbdmp.png) 

![](img/download-bucket.png)  

11.  Now that your files are downloaded, run the scripts to import the schemas to prepare for the In-Memory lab.
````
cd /home/opc/
sudo mv labs.zip /home/oracle
sudo mv ssb.dmp /home/oracle
sudo chown oracle:oinstall /home/oracle/labs.zip 
sudo chown oracle:oinstall /home/oracle/ssb.dmp
sudo su - oracle
unzip labs.zip
````

12.  The next two labs, In-Memory and Multitenant need additional schemas and pluggable databases created.  Run the scripts in the background to create them as the oracle user.  Let's run the multitenant script.  This script takes approximately 15-30 minutes to complete.
````
cd /home/oracle/labs/multitenant
./createCDBs.sh &
````

13.  Open up a 2nd terminal window.  Let's run the script to setup the In-Memory lab.  This script takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.
````
ssh -i ~/.ssh/optionskey opc@<Your Compute Instance Public IP Address>
sudo su - oracle
cd /home/oracle/labs/inmemory
./importssb.sh &
 ````
   ![](img/importssb.png)    

14.  The 1st Multitenant setup script creates two additional listeners and 2 container databases, CDB1 and CDB2.
````
ps -ef | grep tns
ps -ef | grep pmon
````

   ![](img/tnspmon.png)    

Congratulations, you finished!  This is the end of the environment setup lab!
