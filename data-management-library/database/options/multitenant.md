# Lab Introduction #
Oracle Database In-Memory provides a unique dual-format architecture that enables tables to be simultaneously represented in memory using traditional row format and a new in-memory column format. The Oracle SQL Optimizer automatically routes analytic queries to the column format and OLTP queries to the row format, transparently delivering best-of-both-worlds performance. Oracle Database automatically maintains full transactional consistency between the row and the column formats, just as it maintains consistency between tables and indexes today. The new column format is a pure in-memory format and is not persistent on disk, so there are no additional storage costs or storage synchronization issues.

This series of labs will guide you through the basic configuration of the In-Memory column store (IM
column store) as well as illustrating the benefits of its key features:
- In-Memory Column Store Tables
- In-Memory Joins and Aggregation
- In-Memory High Performance Features


# Lab Sections #

## Section 2 - Lab Setup

All the scripts for this lab were unzipped in the environment setup lab and extracted to the /home/oracle/inmemory/scripts folder.  This lab is also available via virtual box [here](http://retriever.us.oracle.com/apex/f?p=121:22:2345499146566662::NO:RP:P22_CONTAINER_ID,P22_PREV_PAGE:82044,112).
