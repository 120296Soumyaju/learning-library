# Lab Introduction #
Oracle Database In-Memory provides a unique dual-format architecture that enables tables to be simultaneously represented in memory using traditional row format and a new in-memory column format. The Oracle SQL Optimizer automatically routes analytic queries to the column format and OLTP queries to the row format, transparently delivering best-of-both-worlds performance. Oracle Database automatically maintains full transactional consistency between the row and the column formats, just as it maintains consistency between tables and indexes today. The new column format is a pure in-memory format and is not persistent on disk, so there are no additional storage costs or storage synchronization issues.

This series of labs will guide you through the basic configuration of the In-Memory column store (IM
column store) as well as illustrating the benefits of its key features:
- In-Memory Column Store Tables
- In-Memory Joins and Aggregation
- In-Memory High Performance Features

We must first establish a performance baseline. It would be unfair to compare the IM column store with disk accessed data. After all, memory access in general is 10X faster than disk. In order to do a fair comparison the performance baseline will be established using the row store memory space, the buffer cache. For the purposes of the lab, the database environment has been sized so that the tables used will fit in both the row store and the column store. The idea is that no buffer accesses will cause physical I/O.

The following 5 table star schema will be used during the lab and has been created for you under the ssb user.

## Section 1: Login to your Oracle Cloud Account

1.  From any browser go to www.oracle.com to access the Oracle Cloud.

    ![](img/login-screen.png)

2. Click the icon in the upper right corner.  Click on **Sign in to Cloud** at the bottom of the drop down.  *NOTE:  Do NOT click the Sign-In button, this will take you to Single Sign-On, not the Oracle Cloud*

    ![](img/signup.png)    

3. Enter your **Cloud Account Name**: `c4u03` in the input field and click the **My Services** button.

4.  Enter your **Username** and **Password** in the input fields and click **Sign In**.

## Section 2 - Lab Setup

All the scripts for this lab are located in the /home/oracle/inmemory/scripts folder.  

1.  To access the scripts, secure shell into the OCI compute instance.

2.  Change to the ssh directory and ssh into your instance.  THe public IP address can be found by going to Compute -> Instance.

    ````
    cd .ssh
    ssh -i optionskey opc@<your public ip address>
    ls
    ````

## Section 3 - Monitoring the In-Memory Column Store

The focus of this section is to show how the lab environment is setup and to demonstrate how to monitor the different parts of the In-Memory column store (IM column store). 

The Oracle environment is already set up so sqlplus can be invoked directly from the shell environment. Since the lab is being run in a pdb called orcl you must supply this alias when connecting to the ssb account. 

1.  Sqlplus into the instance and show sga to see how much memory is in the database.  You can also run @01_show_sga.sql

    ````
    sqlplus ssb/oracle@orcl
    show sga
    ````
   
     ![](img/inmemory/showsga.png) 

2.  The size of the In-Memory column store is controlled by the init.ora parameter INMEMORY_SIZE.  Show the SGA, KEEP and INMEMORY parameters.  You can also run @02_show_parms.sql. 2GB of SGA has been assigned to the IM column store.

    ````
    show parameter sga
    show parameter keep
    show parameter inmemory 
    ````
     ![](img/inmemory/showparms.png) 

3.  The In-Memory area is sub-divided into two pools:  a 1MB pool used to store actual column formatted data populated into memory and a 64K pool to store metadata about the objects populated into the IM columns store.  V$INMEMORY_AREA shows the total IM column store.  

    ````
    select * from v$inmemory_area;
    ````
     ![](img/inmemory/inmemoryarea.png) 

4.  To check if the IM column store is populated with objects run the 05_im_segments.sql script 

    ````
    SQL> @05_im_segments.sql
    ````
     ![](img/inmemory/segments.png)   

5.  To add objects to the IM column store the inmemory attribute needs to be set.  This tells the Oracle DB these tables should be populated into the IM column store.  You can also run `@06_im_alter_table.sql`

    ````
    ALTER TABLE lineorder INMEMORY;
    ALTER TABLE part INMEMORY;
    ALTER TABLE customer INMEMORY;
    ALTER TABLE supplier INMEMORY;
    ALTER TABLE date_dim INMEMORY;
    ````
     ![](img/inmemory/altertable.png)   

6.  Run the `@07_im_attibutes.sql script`.  THis looks at the USER_TABLES view and queries attributes of tables in the SSB schema.

    ````
    SELECT table_name, cache, buffer_pool, compression, compress_for, inmemory,
        inmemory_priority, inmemory_distribute, inmemory_compression 
    FROM   user_tables; 
    ````
     ![](img/inmemory/imattributes.png)   

By default the IM column store is only populated when the object is accessed.

7.  Let's populate the store with some simple queries with the @08_im_start_pop.sql

    ````
    SELECT /*+ full(d)  noparallel (d )*/ Count(*)   FROM   date_dim d; 
    SELECT /*+ full(s)  noparallel (s )*/ Count(*)   FROM   supplier s; 
    SELECT /*+ full(p)  noparallel (p )*/ Count(*)   FROM   part p; 
    SELECT /*+ full(c)  noparallel (c )*/ Count(*)   FROM   customer c; 
    SELECT /*+ full(lo)  noparallel (lo )*/ Count(*) FROM   lineorder lo; 
    ````
     ![](img/inmemory/startpop.png) 

8. Background processes are populating these segments into the IM column store.  To monitor this, you could query the V$IM_SEGMENTS.  Once the data population is complete, the BYTES_NOT_POPULATED should be 0 for each segment.

    ````
    SELECT v.owner, v.segment_name name, 
       v.populate_status status, v.bytes on_disk_size,
       v.inmemory_size in_mem_size, v.bytes_not_populated
    FROM   v$im_segments v;
    ````

     ![](img/inmemory/im_populated.png) 

9.  Now let's check the total space usage

    ````
    select * from v$inmemory_area;
    ````

    ![](img/inmemory/im_usage.png) 

## Section 4 - Querying the In-Memory Column Store

Now that you’ve gotten familiar with the IM column store let’s look at the benefits of using it. You will execute a series of queries against the large fact table LINEORDER, in both the buffer cache and the IM column store, to demonstrate the different ways the IM column store can improve query performance above and beyond the basic performance benefits of accessing data in memory only.

1. Exit your previous sqlplus session and change to the Part2 directory to access the SQL files for this part of the Lab.

    ````
    cd ../Part2
    ls
    sqlplus /nolog
    ````
