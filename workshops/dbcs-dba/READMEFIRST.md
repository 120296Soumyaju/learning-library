- This workshop has multiple versions. If you use the GitHub Pages link above, you will be presented with a version selection page. If you prefer to browse the workshop using the GitHub repository view, you should choose one of the following files to get started:

  - [Intro.md](Intro.md): This version of the workshop assumes you will use an **Oracle-provided virtual machine image** to complete the workshop. This image has many of the command line tools that are required for the worksop preinstalled.

  - [Intro-Linux.md](Intro-Linux.md): This version of the workshop assumes you will use **your own laptop** or your own virtual machine that has a Linux or Mac operating system installed. Use of a Windows machine is possible, but you will need to adapt many of the command line instructions to Windows conventions (e.g. using backslashes in paths and .exe for executable files).
