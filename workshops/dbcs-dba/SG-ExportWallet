### **STEP 11**:  Export Encryption Keys from NEW_PDB

All DBCS instances have both an auto open wallet and a password wallet.  When moving data the **password wallet** must move with the data.  To open the password wallet you must first remove the auto open wallet.

-	Review status of encryption wallet.  Open a terminal window (or use your existing open window) and enter the following.
	- `. oraenv` (enter ORCL when prompted).
	- `sqlplus sys/ALpha2018__ as sysdba`
	- `select * from v$encryption_wallet;`

-	Shut down the database, remove the auto-open wallet, and start the database back up again.  We will be using the password wallet.  Enter the following commands in the open terminal window.
	- `shutdown immediate;`
	- `exit`
	- `mv  /opt/oracle/dcs/commonstore/wallets/tde/<your database unique name for WorkshopImage>/cwallet.sso /opt/oracle/dcs/commonstore/wallets/tde/cwallet.sso`
	- `sqlplus sys/ALpha2018__ as sysdba`
	- `startup`
	- `alter pluggable database all open;`

-	Review the status of the **password wallet**.  Enter the following.
	- `select * from v$encryption_wallet;`

-	Note the password wallet is closed in the CDB.  We need to open the password keystore in the CDB, and also in the PDB(s).  Now that the auto open wallet has been removed opening and closing wallets and keystores is a manual process.
	- `administer key management set keystore open identified by ALpha2018__ container=all;`
	- `alter session set container=new_pdb;`
	- `administer key management set keystore open force keystore identified by ALpha2018__;`

-	Now we can export the encryption keys to the pluggable database.  Enter the following commands. 
	- `administer key management export encryption keys with secret "Alpha2018_" to '/home/oracle/new_pdb.p12' identified by ALpha2018__;`
