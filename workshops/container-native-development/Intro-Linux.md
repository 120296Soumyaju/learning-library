## Container Native Application Development Workshop

Welcome to the Oracle Public Cloud Container Native Development workshop. This workshop will walk you through the process of moving an existing application into a containerized CI/CD pipeline and deploying it to a managed Kubernetes service in the Oracle Public Cloud.

You will take on 2 personas during the workshop. The Lead Developer Persona will be responsible for configuring the parts of the automated build and deploy process that involve details about the application itself. The DevOps Engineer Persona will configure the parts of the automation involving the Kubernetes infrastructure. To containerize and automate the building and deploying of this application you will make use of Wercker Pipelines, Oracle Container Registry, and Oracle Container Engine.
