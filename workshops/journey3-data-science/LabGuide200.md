In the Services tab of the Oracle Big Data Cloud Service - Compute Edition Console, click **Create Service**.

![](images/200/image3.png) 

The Oracle Big Data Cloud Service - Compute Edition Create Service wizard starts and the Service page is
displayed.

On the Service page, provide a **name** and description for the new cluster, click **Next** to advance to the
Service Details page.

![](images/200/image4.png)

The Service Details page is displayed.

Complete the **Cluster Configuration** section:-
- **Number of Nodes** – Number of nodes to be allocated to the cluster. For this tutorial, you can start
with **1** node; more nodes can be added later.
- **Compute Shape** – From the drop down list, specify the compute shape for each node in terms of OCPU and memory. For this tutorial, we recommend you start with **2 OCPU**.
- **Usable HDFS Storage** – Amount of HDFS storage to be allocated to the cluster. For this tutorial, we
recommend you start with **50GB**.
- **Queue Profile** – YARN capacity scheduler queue profile. Defines how queues and workloads are
managed. Select **Preemption On**.

Complete the **Credentials** section:-
- **SSH Public Key** – The SSH public key to be used for authentication when using an SSH client to
connect to a node associated with your cluster. Click **Edit** to specify the public key. You can upload a
file containing the public key value, paste in the value of a public key, or have the wizard generate a
key pair for you. If you paste in the value, make sure the value does not contain line breaks or end
with a line break. If you have the wizard generate a key pair for you, make sure you download the zip
file containing the keys that the wizard generated. **Note** that you will need the private key when you
connect to the node in the cluster via SSH in the steps later.
- **Administrative User** – User name used to log in to the cluster console and REST APIs for job
submission.
- **Password** – Password of the user specified above.

Keep the user name and password in mind for later steps in this tutorial.

Complete the **Cloud Storage Credentials** section:-
- **Cloud Storage Container** – Name of an existing Oracle Storage Cloud Service container to be
associated with the cluster, or a new one to be created. The format is
Storage-<identity_domain>/<container>, where <identity_domain> is the ID of the identity domain,
and <container> is the name of the container, for example, _Storage-abc 05202 /journeyTwo_.
- **Username** – User name of the user who has access to the specified Oracle Storage Cloud
Service container.
- **Password** – The password of the above user.
- **Create Cloud Storage Container** – select this to create a new Oracle Storage Cloud Service container
as part of cluster creation if you want. We select to create a new container in this demo.

Click **Next** to advance to the Confirmation page.

![](images/200/image5.png)

On the Confirmation page, review the information listed. If you're satisfied with what you see, click **Create**
to create the cluster.

![](images/200/image6.png)

When the BDCS-CE cluster instance is ready, you need to enable the network access to the BDCS-CE
server via the SSH protocol.

From the BDCS-CE Services page, navigate to **Access Rules** for the BDCS-CE instance. The Access Rules are
accessible from the clickable menu icon as shown above.

![](images/200/image7.png) 

Then, on the Access Rules page, enable the **ssh (port 22)** access rule by choosing **Enable** from the
clickable menu under the Actions column as shown below.

# Move data across your local and cloud storage

![](images/200/image8.png) 

Go back to the My Services Dashboard page. It lists the services that are assigned to your account.

Look for and click **Storage**.

![](images/200/image9.png) 

The Service Details page is displayed.

Look at the identity domain name, data jurisdiction, and URLs displayed in the REST Endpoint and Auth V
Endpoint fields under Additional Information.

You will need to refer back to the information in this page when you setup CloudBerry for Oracle Storage
Cloud Service in the following steps.

![](images/200/image10.png) 

CloudBerry Explorer for OpenStack provides a user interface to cloud storage accounts allowing managing
and moving data across your local and cloud storage.

Launch CloudBerry Explorer if you have installed it, click **File** , and select **New Oracle Cloud Account** option.

![](images/200/image11.png)

To complete the setup in the Add New Oracle Cloud Storage Account dialog, you may need to copy the
identity domain and URLs from the Service Details: Oracle Storage Cloud Service page we mentioned at
the beginning of this section.
- Insert a **display name** of your choice.
- Insert the user name, the **user name** is in the format **Storage-<identity-domain>:<username>** ,
where <username> is the username of your Oracle Public Cloud, that has the correct rights to the
Oracle Storage Cloud Service. For example, _Storage-myDomainID555:myCloudAdminName_
- Insert the **password** that matches the previous username.
- Insert the **Authentication Service URL** , it will look like this:
**https://<identity-domain>.storage.oraclecloud.com/auth/v1.**.
- In the **account location** select the Data Jurisdiction, for example, US Commercial 2(us2).

Click **Test Connection** to validate your setup. Then click **OK**.

Once you set up the Oracle Storage Cloud account successfully, you can manage and move data across
your local and cloud storage. You can drag and drop a data file from your local computer to the cloud
storage easily.


You can also move data across your local and cloud storage with [Oracle Storage Cloud Service - File Transfer Manager CLI](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/cloud/downloads/storage-cloud-upload-cli-3424297.html). It is a Java-based command line tool (CLI) that simplifies uploading to and downloading from Oracle Storage Cloud Service. Please refer [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/iaas/storage-cloud/csclr/preparing-use-oracle-storage-cloud-file-transfer-manager-cli.html#GUID-5BB8647F-DDAD-4371-A519-1116402245FB) for more details about it.
