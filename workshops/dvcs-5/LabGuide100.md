    ![](images/100/img_1b_2_2.png)
    
    The application follows standard web and application interface protocols, thus supporting both left and right click interactions. In terms of general navigation, there are 4 key menus accessible at the top of the screen or via a hamburger menu in the top left (not all screens will show the top menu bar but the hamburger navigation is always available).

    - **Home**: Application start up page from where you can view existing projects, data sets, data flows or create new ones. 
    
    - **Projects**:  Collections of visualizations and the underlying data sources. **Folders** are simply means by which to organize projects.
    
    - **Data**: This page allows you to display or create **Data Sets** (instances of data such as a specific Excel file); **Connections** (connections to data sources such as a database or SaaS application to pull data files); or **Data Flows** (ability to curate data from data sources including adding calculations, merging multiple sources, and managing columns).
    
    - **Machine Learning**: This page shows all the available machine learning models ready for use in projects.
    
    - **Console**: Administrative menu for managing **Custom Plugins** (e.g. new types of analyses obtained from the Oracle Analytics Store or custom built), **Maps** layers (e.g. new backgrounds for map based analyses) and other administrative tasks.
    
    - **Academy**: Home to important links to the OAC documentation and videos that help you accomplish common tasks in the OAC. 
   
3. At the top-right of the UI, click on the Create button.

    This window allows you to create a Visualization project, a data set, a connection to an external source, a data flow, a sequence...

4. Click on hamburger icon at the top right of the UI, next to Create.
