    The application follows standard web and application interface protocols, thus supporting both left and right click interactions. In terms of general navigation, there are 4 key menus accessible at the top of the screen or via a hamburger menu in the top left (not all screens will show the top menu bar but the hamburger navigation is always available).

    - **Home**: Application start up page from where you can view existing projects and folders or create new ones. **Projects** in DV are a collection of visualizations and the underlying data sources. **Folders** are simply means by which to organize projects.
    
    - **Data Visualization**: This is where you will spend a good portion of your time when analyzing data. It allows you to manage and edit all facets of a project (e.g. the visualizations and the source data).
    
    - **Data Sources**: This page allows you to **Display** or **Create Data Sources** (instances of data such as a specific Excel file); **Connections** (connections to data sources such as a database or SaaS application to pull data files); or **Data Flows** (ability to curate data from data sources including adding calculations, merging multiple sources, and managing columns).
    
    - **Console**: Administrative menu for managing **Custom Plugins** (e.g. new types of analyses obtained from the Oracle Analytics Store or custom built) and **Maps** layers (e.g. new backgrounds for map based analyses).
    
3. At the top-right of the UI, click on the Create button.

    This window allows you to create a Visualization project, a data set, a connection to an external source, a data flow, a sequence...

4. Click on hamburger icon at the top right of the UI, next to Create.
