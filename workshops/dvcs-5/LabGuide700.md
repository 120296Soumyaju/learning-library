# Lab 7 – Explore HCM Data
In this last lab, you will continue to be challenged to apply what you’ve learned in the previous labs. You will create visualizations and Insights involving mashing up some HCM data (attrition, job vacancies, reasons why people are leaving) with your ERP data. Feel free to ask for help if you get stuck!


You will need to have completed Lab 5 to complete this lab.

##7a – Add Data Sources and Create Visualizations of HCM Data


###1) Create visualizations of data regarding employees who have left the company.

Steps required:
Open the DVD **Project** you created in Lab 5.

Create a new file based data source using the **HCM Data - Leavers.xlsx** file.
Preview the data and change the **Voluntary Turnover** and **Involuntary Turnover** fields to Measures. Add it to your project.

Create a new **Canvas**.

Clear any existing filters and add **Business Lines** to the filter area and then filter on **Capital Equipment**.

Create a **Stacked Bar** chart of **Voluntary Turnover** and **Involuntary Turnover** by **Month Name** (Make sure that both the **Voluntary Turnover** and **Involuntary Turnover** measures are in the **Value - Y-Axis**). Change the colors (hint: **right-click**, select **Color**, and select **Reset Visualization Colors**)

Create a **Donut** chart on the right side of **Voluntary Turnover** by **Job Description**.
