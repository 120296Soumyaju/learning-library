## Oracle Analytics Cloud Workshop

Welcome to the Oracle Analytics Cloud workshop. This workshop will introduce you to the data visualization capabilities included in OAC. Data Visualization allows you to analyze data coming directly from a wide variety of sources. These can include Oracle SaaS applications (e.g. ERP Cloud), databases, local files, and 3rd party applications (e.g. Salesforce), amongst others. For the purpose of this workshop, we will be using Excel files.
