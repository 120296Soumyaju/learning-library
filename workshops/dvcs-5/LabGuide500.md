## Lab 5 – Predicting Subscriptions - Machine Learning

Key Take Aways from this lab:
- Learning how to create Dataflows
- Using the **Machine Learning** abilities of OAC

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning, at its most basic, is the usage of algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something. The Machine Learning abilities of OAC5 allow you to make predictions based on your data set. Data Visualization also provides scripts to train data models that you can add to other data sets to predict trends and patterns in data.

### Scenario

When customers purchase products through a partner, KoolKart would like to include a discount coupon in the shipping confirmation email as an incentive for users to subscribe to the KoolKart mailing list. Now, Isla Stuart, who works in the market research department has to understand the customer demographics and figure out how big the incentive should be. 

To do this, Isla  has already obtained 4 different data sets: Orders, Customers, Subscriptions and Partner Sales. She wants to look at subscription patterns on the KoolKart website and develop a model that looks at past subscription data to determine how Customer Age Group, Customer Gender, Customer Country and  purchased Product Category influence the likeliness to subscribe. 

Isla knows that she needs to use KoolKart Orders and KoolKart Customers data sets together. Most importantly, she decides to utilize the Data Flow functionality of OAC that allows her to create a data set tailored to her needs. Let's start!

### 5a) Creating a Data Flow for Koolkart Orders and Customers

1. Create a Data Flow and add a data set

    Select the hamburger menu button and click on the Home button.

    ![](images/800/img_8e_1_1.png)

    Select **Create** and then **Data Flow**. 

    ![](images/800/img_8e_1_2.png)

    Add the **Koolkart Orders** data set.

    ![](images/800/img_8e_1_3.png)

2. Once the **Data Flow Editor** opens up, click the **Add Data** icon in the **Data Flow Steps** and drag it to the editor. 

    ![](images/800/img_8e_2_1.png)
    
    Add the **KoolKart Customers** data set by selecting **KoolKart Customers** and selecting **Add**.

    ![](images/800/img_8e_2_2.png)

    Click on **Join** and add it to the data flow. 

    ![](images/800/img_8e_2_3.png)

    Ideally, OAC should detect the joining logic, but in case it doesn't, you will see an Incomplete join message. Click on the circle to complete the join. 

    ![](images/800/img_8e_2_4.png)

    If you've succesfully made the join, the dataflow will reflect the image below. 

    ![](images/800/img_8e_2_5.png)

3. The **Movies & Music** category is not required for the analysis. So, we add a filter to the **Data Flow**.
    
    Select **Filter** and drag between **KoolKart Orders** and **Join**.

    ![](images/800/img_8e_3_1.png)

    Select the **+** and select the category attribute. 

    ![](images/800/img_8e_3_2.png)

    Select **Movies & Music** to move it to the **Selections**. Click on the hamburger option, and select **Exclude Selections**.

    ![](images/800/img_8e_3_3.png)

4. Add **Select Columns** to the Data flow and exclude the duplicated **Customer ID**.
    
    Select **Select Columns** and drag it to **+** on in front of Join.
    
    ![](images/800/img_8e_4_1.png)

    Select **Customer_ID1** and click on **Remove Selected**.

    ![](images/800/img_8e_4_2.png)

5. Group Sales data into Regions. 

    Select **+** next to **Select Columns** and then select **Group**.

    ![](images/800/img_8e_5_1.png)

    Set the group name to **Sales Region**.
    Name the first group **NA** and add **Canada** and **USA** to the group.

    ![](images/800/img_8e_5_2.png)
    
    Select **+ Group** to add a second group and name it **EMEA**. Add the following countries to the group: **France**, **United Kingdom**, and **Germany**.

    Select **+ Group** to add a third group and name it **APAC**. Add **Japan** to the group.

    ![](images/800/img_8e_5_3.png)

    Now, drag **Save Data Set** into the editor. Save the data set as **KoolKarts Orders & Customers**. Set **Order ID** and **Customer ID** to attributes.

    ![](images/800/img_8e_5_3_2.png)
    
    ![](images/800/img_8e_5_3_3.png)

    Save the **Data Flow** by clicking the Save button in the top corner. 

    ![](images/800/img_8e_5_4.png)
    
    Name the data flow **KoolKart Dataflow**.

### 5d) Using the Explain feature to create a visualization
    
Let's take a few moments to learn more about the **Explain** feature. The **Explain** feature allows you to uncover insights and patterns about a particular column within a data set. 
    
1. Right-click the **Category** attribute and selcted **Explain Category**. 
   
   ![](images/800/img_8d_1_1.png)

2. Look at **Explain Category** window and observe some the basic insights. 
   
   ![](images/800/img_8d_2_1.png)
  
  The **Explain** feature parses the data set and presents different insights about the **Category** column. Listed below is a description of what **Basic Facts**, **Key Drivers**, **Segments** and **Anomalies entail**:

Basic Facts
- Shows the basic distribution of the data element (attribute or measure) values across the data set and its breakdown against each one of the measures in the data set.

Key Drivers 
- Shows data elements (attributes or measures) that are more highly correlated to the outcome for the selected data. You will see charts showing the distribution of the selected attribute value across each of the correlated attributes values.

Segments that Explain
- Shows the segments or group in the data set, after examining all the records that can predict the value of the selected data element. You can select a particular segment or group and then continue to analyze it.

Anomalies 
- Shows the group of anomalies or unusual values in the data set that you can relate to the selected data element (attribute or measure). You can review and select particular group of anomalies.


3. Add a visualization to the the canvas using the explain feature.

    Select the check on the right corner of the visual and click **Add Selected**.
    
    ![](images/800/img_8d_3_1.png)

    If you've successfully added the visualization, your canvas should reflect the image below.
