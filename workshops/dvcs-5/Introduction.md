## Oracle Analytics Cloud v5 Workshop

Welcome to the Oracle Analytics Cloud v5 workshop. This workshop will introduce you to the data visualization capabilities included in OAC. Data Visualization allows you to analyze data based on a pre-built OAC subject area or based on data coming directly from a wide variety of sources. These can include Oracle SaaS applications (e.g. ERP Cloud), databases, and 3rd party applications (e.g. Salesforce), amongst others. For the purpose of this workshop, we will be using Excel files.

## Workshop Format

The workshop is broken out in to sections (i.e. labs) which focus on various facets of the tool. Certain labs are optional and are identified as such. In terms of timing, this workshop can typically be completed within 4 hours, though individual experiences may vary.

## Oracle Analytics Cloud

Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) is a cloud-first analytics platform, providing fast and flexible analysis of any data from any source. It is built on the industry-leading Oracle Business Intelligence platform and Oracle’s top tier cloud infrastructure.

Oracle Analytics Cloud delivers scalability, high availability, state-of-the-art security, and operational simplicity. This combination of proven technologies, world-class infrastructure, broad data access, and deep analytic capabilities makes Oracle Analytics Cloud the best solution for every user.

The goal of today’s workshop is to introduce you to the data visualization capabilities included in OAC. We will be analyzing data using local Excel files. Data Visualization also allows you to analyze data based on a pre-built OAC subject area or based on data coming directly from a wide variety of sources. These can include Oracle SaaS applications (e.g. ERP Cloud), databases, and 3rd party applications (e.g. Salesforce), amongst others.

## What are Data Visualizations?

Data Visualization is a tool that enables you to explore analytical data visually and individually. The capabilities are available both via a web-based interface as well as via a local client.

Data Visualization makes it easy to visualize your data, so you can focus on exploring interesting patterns and outliers. Just upload your data files or connect to a data source, select the elements you are interested in, and let Data Visualization find the best way to visualize it. Of course, you can also choose from a wide range of visualizations yourself if you want to look at your data in a specific way.

- **Creating visualizations is easy**. Your data analysis work is an individual experience in exploration and discovery that can also be shared with other users. Data Visualization enables you to experiment with a wealth of different options for how to view your data. During this experimentation process you can find correlations, discover patterns, and see trends in your content.

- Data Visualization provides you with tools for faster and simpler assembly of detailed reports arranged together in an appealing and meaningful display. Data Visualization goes even further, to give you dynamic views for focused, exploratory interaction with your data.

### Data Visualization provides the following:

- **Guidance**: Grammar-centric approach to visualizations combined with powerful keyword search and pattern detection to aid all users making new discoveries.

- **Richness**: Robust visualization library and streamlined dashboard construction provide all the tools needed for constructing sophisticated analysis across many different perspectives of data

- **Visual Grammar**: Visualizations automatically created and updated by applying visual grammar to data selections made by user. All visualization types share foundation in visual grammar

- **Keyword Search**: All relevant artifacts are indexed for search. Unfamiliar data models can be intuitively accessed using keywords

- **Pattern Brushing**: Sophisticated technique to highlight correlations between visualizations. Patterns highlighted across all components on the canvas

- **Data Blending**: Combining two or more data sources for analysis

Now let’s get started!
