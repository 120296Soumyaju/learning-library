# ADWC Journey: Hands-On Test Drive Workshop
This workshop walks you through all the steps to get started using the **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud (ADWC)**. You will provision a new ADWC database, load data from the object store and troubleshoot data loads, query external data residing on the object store, manage an ADWC instance, scale an ADWC instance, and use Oracle Machine Learning notebooks.


## Goals

 - Get comfortable with Oracle's public cloud services
 - Provision a new ADWC database
 - Run sample queries against the sample data sets
 - Load data from the object store
 - Query external data from the object store
 - Manage and Monitor an ADWC instance
 - Scale an ADWC instance
 - Use Oracle Machine Learning notebooks
