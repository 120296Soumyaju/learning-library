## Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Services Workshop for Developers

Welcome to the Oracle Data Warehouse Cloud Service Workshop for developers.  These labs will give you a basic understanding of ADWC and many of the capabilities that support DBAs, citizen scientist developers, and line of business end users. It will also give some perspectives on why Oracle's ADWC solution is the culmination of decades of research and development on the Oracle Database platform, and how it compares to alternative data warehouse cloud solutions.  We will take on three personas: the DBA who concerned about managing large volumes of data with end user ad-hoc access, the citizen data scientist who is challeged with extracting and processing data for analysis, and the line of business marketing manager who wants to be able to slice and dice data for analysis in support of a wide variety of marketing programs.

Lab 100 will introduce you to ADWC and show you how to create a Cloud Database. Lab 200 will show how ADWC can query billions of rows of data without the need for advance tuning. Lab 300 shows how ADWC can support citizen data scientists as they create models to predict future customer behaviour. Lab 400 shows how Oracle Analytic Cloud can visualize machine learning, marketing, and sales data for a variety of use cases, including speculative qeuries of an ad-hoc nature.
