Running Hive and Zeppelin/Spark on a 2 OCPUs instance\n\nSome of you may be running this tutorial on the smallest configuration size (2 OCPUs).  If you are using this small shape, there can be scenarios where your Hive commands get \"Accepted\" but do not progress to \"Processing\".  You can see this behavior in the Jobs tab.  If this happens, then your Hive commands will hang indefinitely.  The reason this happens is that with 2 OCPUs, all of the available processing threads in the YARN resource manager can be occupied by other jobs.  There is a simple solution if you see this happen:  simply go to the Jobs tab, find the \"Zeppelin\" job, and abort it.  You will find that your Hive job will then move from \"Accepted\" to \"Processing\" and then finish.  The \"Zeppelin\" job will relaunch itself automatically the next time you run something with the Spark Interpreter inside Zeppelin.\n\nAn alternate solution is to add another node to your BDCS-CE cluster.
