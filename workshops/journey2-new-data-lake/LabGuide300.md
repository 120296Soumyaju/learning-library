## Introduction

This lab will walk you through getting to know **Oracle Big Data Cloud Service - Compute Edition (BDCS-CE)**.  

You will use the Notebook feature of BDCS-CE to run a series of tutorials that show you different aspects of functionality.  You will learn how to work with the **Zeppelin Notebook**.  Another tutorial will show you to interact with **Hive**.   Then you will learn how to interact with **Spark** and **Spark SQL**. And a final tutorial will show you how to use **Oracle Cloud Storage Object Store**.  

Notebooks are used to explore and visualize data in an iterative and easily documented fashion. Oracle Big Data Cloud Service - Compute Edition uses Apache Zeppelin as its notebook interface and coding environment.  Information about Zeppelin can be found here: [https://zeppelin.apache.org/](https://zeppelin.apache.org/) .  To see examples of notes created and shared by other Zeppelin users, see [https://www.zeppelinhub.com/viewer](https://www.zeppelinhub.com/viewer) .

## Objectives

- Learn how to import notes into the BDCS-CE Notebook
- Learn how to work with the BDCS-CE Notebook
- Learn how to work with Hive
- Learn how to work with Spark and Spark SQL
- Learn how to work with Oracle Cloud Storage Object Store

## Required Artifacts

- A running BDCS-CE instance and Storage Cloud Object Store instance (you created these in the previous lab)
- Zip file of lab tutorials for the BDCS-CE Notebook, which can be downloaded from here: [Lab300Tutorials.zip](files/Lab300Tutorials.zip)

# Import the tutorial notes into the BDCS-CE Notebook

## Download the Tutorials zip file for this lab

### **STEP 1**: Download the Tutorials zip file 

- Download the Tutorials zip file from here: [Lab300Tutorials.zip](files/Lab300Tutorials.zip)

### **STEP 2**: Unzip the Tutorials zip file

- Unzip the tutorials file on your workstation.  There should be a number of files with .json extensions.


## Connect to the BDCS-CE Console

### **STEP 1**: Navigate/login to the Oracle Cloud My Services Dashboard

### **STEP 2**: Navigate to the My Services page for your BDCS-CE cluster

- ![](images/300/snap0011989.jpg)  

### **STEP 3**: Launch the Big Data Cluster Console

- Launch the Big Data Cluster Console for your BDCS-CE cluster.  If this is your first time, you will likely need to allow your browser to accept the self-signed certificate for the web console application.
- You will be asked to provide a username/password.  Use the username and password you defined earlier when you created the BDCS-CE instance (the username defaults to bdcsce_admin).  If you are an Oracle Employee/Partner using a GSE "deal server" pre-provisioned environment, the un/pw will be set to bdcsce_admin/Welcome321

## Import the Tutorial Notes into the BDCS-CE Notebook

### **STEP 1**: Navigate to the Notebook tab  


### **STEP 2**: Click Import Note.  Browse your workstation to import the first tutorial .json file.

- The .json files were downloaded and unzipped earlier in this lab.
