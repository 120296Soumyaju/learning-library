## Introduction

This lab will walk you through getting to know **Oracle Big Data Cloud Service - Compute Edition (BDCS-CE)**.  

You will use the Notebook feature of BDCS-CE to run a series of tutorials that show you different aspects of functionality.  You will learn how to work with the **Zeppelin Notebook**.  Another tutorial will show you to interact with **Hive**.   Then you will learn how to interact with **Spark** and **Spark SQL**. And a final tutorial will show you how to use **Oracle Cloud Storage Object Store**.  

Notebooks are used to explore and visualize data in an iterative and easily documented fashion. Oracle Big Data Cloud Service - Compute Edition uses Apache Zeppelin as its notebook interface and coding environment.  Information about Zeppelin can be found here: [https://zeppelin.apache.org/](https://zeppelin.apache.org/) .  To see examples of notes created and shared by other Zeppelin users, see [https://www.zeppelinhub.com/viewer](https://www.zeppelinhub.com/viewer) .
