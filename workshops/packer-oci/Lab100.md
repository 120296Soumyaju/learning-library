## Objectives

- Obtain an Oracle Cloud Trial Account
- Create the baseline infrastructure to support a Custom Compute image
- Create a SSH key pair


## Required Artifacts

- If running from Windows: [Putty and PuttyGen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

# Log into  your Trial Account and Create Infrastructure

You will create all required infrastructure components within your Trail account.

## Your Trial Account

### **Step 1**: Your Oracle Cloud Trial Account

- You have already applied for and received you're Oracle Cloud Trial Account and will change the default password...


### **STEP 2**: Log in to your OCI dashboard

- Once you receive the **Get Started with Oracle Cloud** Email, make note of your **Username, Password and Cloud Account Name**.

  ![](images/050Linux/0.1.png)

- From any browser go to. :

    [https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/sign-in](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/sign-in)

- Enter your **Cloud Account Name** in the input field and click the **My Services** button. If you have a trial account, this can be found in your welcome email. Otherwise, this will be supplied by your workshop instructor.

  ![](images/050Linux/1.png)

- Enter your **Username** and **Password** in the input fields and click **Sign In**.

  ![](images/050Linux/2.png)

**NOTE**: You may (probably) will be prompted to change the temporary password listed in the welcome email. In that case, enter the new password in the password field.

- In the top left corner of the dashboard, click the **hamburger menu**

  ![](images/050Linux/3.1.png)
  ![](images/050Linux/3.2.png)

- Select to expand the **Identity** submenu, then click **Compartments**

  ![](images/050Linux/4.1.png)


### **STEP 3**: Create a Compartment

Compartments are used to isolate resources within your OCI tenant. User & Group-based access policies can be applied to manage access to compute instances and other resources within a Compartment.

  - Click **Create Compartment**

    ![](images/050Linux/5.1.png)

  - In the **Name** field, enter any name you want. For this example we will be using the name `Packer` going forward. Enter a **Description** of your choice. Click **Create Compartment**.

    ![](images/050Linux/8.1.png)

  - In a moment, your new Compartment will show up in the list.

    ![](images/050Linux/9.1.PNG)

### **STEP 4**: Create a Virtual Compute Network

We need a default VCN to define our networking within the `Packer` compartment (_Or the name you used for your compartment_). This Virtual Cloud Network is where Subnets and Security Lists, get defined for each Availablity Domains in your Tenancy. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is hosted in regions and availability domains. A region is a localized geographic area (e.g. PHX or IAD), and an availability domain is one or more data centers located within a region (e.g. IAD - AD1). A region is composed of several availability domains. Availability domains are isolated from each other, fault tolerant, and very unlikely to fail simultaneously. Because availability domains do not share infrastructure such as power or cooling, or the internal availability domain network, a failure at one availability domain is unlikely to impact the availability of the others.

All the availability domains in a region are connected to each other by a low latency, high bandwidth network, which makes it possible for you to provide high-availability connectivity to the Internet and customer premises, and to build replicated systems in multiple availability domains for both high-availability and disaster recovery.

- Click the **hamburger icon** in the upper left corner to open the navigation menu. Under the **Networking** section of the menu, click **Virtual Cloud Networks**

    ![](images/050Linux/10.PNG)

- Select your compartment from the LOV.

    ![](images/050Linux/10.1.png)

- Click **Create Virtual Cloud Network**

    ![](images/050Linux/11.1.PNG)

- Fill in the follow values as highlighted below:

   ??? **NOTE:** Make sure to de-select the "USE DNS HOSTNAMES IN THIS VCN" checkbox)

    ![](images/050Linux/12.1.PNG)

    ![](images/050Linux/13.PNG)

- Click **Create Virtual Cloud Network**

- Click **Close** on the details page:

    ![](images/050Linux/14.PNG)a

- You will see:

    ![](images/050Linux/15.PNG)

### **STEP 5**: Add a Security List entry

A security list provides a virtual firewall for an instance, with ingress and egress rules that specify the types of traffic allowed in and out. Each security list is enforced at the instance level. However, you configure your security lists at the subnet level, which means that all instances in a given subnet are subject to the same set of rules. The security lists apply to a given instance whether it's talking with another instance in the VCN or a host outside the VCN.

- Click on the **packer-build** and then "Default Security List for packer-build" under **Security Lists**

    ![](images/050Linux/16.1.PNG)

    ![](images/050Linux/17.1.PNG)



For the purposes of the upcoming Packer-built image deployments, we need to add a couple of Ingress Rules that allow VNC access from the Internet to ports 5910 and 5911. 

- Click **Edit All Rules** and then select **+ Another Ingress Rule**

  **`NOTE: Our goal is to add new rules, not change existing ones...`**

    ![](images/050Linux/18.1.PNG)

    ![](images/050Linux/19.1.PNG)

- **Enter the following as Rule 4 (or the next in your tenant)**

**NOTE:** Leave all other values at default

```
Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
Destination Port Range: 5910-5911
```

- Click the **Save Security List Rules** button at the bottom of the page

    ![](images/050Linux/22.1.PNG)

- Your Ingress Rules should look like:

    ![](images/050Linux/22.2.png)

 This opens port 5910 & 5911 to the public internet! for the purposes of this lab, we should be fine.  If you do this in any other account (e.g. not your 30-day trial), pay close attention to the ports your open.  You can enter very narrow port ranges to lock port access down to a single corporate network, or corporate networks + hosted servers specifically designed to access and audit administrative access to cloud instances.  

### **STEP 6**: Create SSH Key Pair (Linux or Mac client)

Before we create the Compute instance that will let us install packer, we need to create an ssh key pair so we will be able to securely connect to the instance.

**NOTE:** `This step focuses on key pair generation for Linux or Mac based terminal sessions. If your going to run your terminal sessions from a Windows client then skip to STEP 7`

- In a `Linux/Mac` client terminal window **Type** the following (**You don't have to worry about any passphrases unless you want to enter one**)

```
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f packerkey
```

- Your key pair is now in the current directory

    ![](images/050Linux/24.1.PNG)

- **NOTE for Linux and Mac Clients:** Just open up the pubic key file in an editor (vi) and select / copy the entire contents to be used in Step 8.   

```
vi packerkey.pub
```
   ![](images/050Linux/25-4.PNG)
    
### **STEP 7**: Create SSH Key Pair (Windows client)

For Windows clients this example will show the use of PuttyGen to generate the keypair. [Putty and PuttyGen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) are available for download.

- Run **PuttyGen** and click **Generate**

    ![](images/050Linux/25.PNG)

- Once the generation process completes click the **Save Private Key** button and save to a directory of your choice.

- If prompted to save without a passphrase click yes.

    ![](images/050Linux/25a.png)

**NOTE:** `Do not save the public key as the format is not compatable with Linux openSSH.

- Instead, **Select the entire Public Key in the display and right-click copy**. `This content will be pasted into the Create Instance dialog in Step 8.`

    ![](images/050Linux/25-2.PNG)

### **STEP 8**: Create a Compute Instance

You will now create a CentOS-based Compute instance using the public key you just generated.

- Go back to your OCI console and from the hamburger menu in the upper left hand corner select **Compute-->Instances**

    ![](images/050Linux/26.PNG)

- Click **Create Instance**

   ![](images/050Linux/26.1.PNG)

- **You will (Select / Leave Default) or Type** the following in the `Create Compute Instance` section of the dialog:

```
Name: packer-builder
Availability Domain: AD 1 (Use default AD 1)
Boot Volume: Oracle-Provided OS Image
Image Operating System: CentOS7  <change to>
Shape Type: Virtual Machine (Default)
Shape: VM.Standard2.1 (Default)
SSH Keys: Choose SSH Key Files
```

- After entering the _packer-builder    _ instance name click the **Change Image Source**.

   ![](images/050Linux/27-3.PNG)

- Select **CentsOS 7** and click **Select Image**.

   ![](images/050Linux/27-5.PNG)

- This selection will now be shown on the page:

   ![](images/050Linux/27.7.PNG)

- Scroll down furthur on the page and select your PUBLIC SSH Key
**NOTE:** You will paste the public key you copied in Step 7 into the SSH KEY field by selecting the "Paste SSH Keys" radio button. `The public key should all be on ONE LINE`

   ![](images/050Linux/28.1.PNG)

- In the Configure networking Section you will take ALL of the defaults as shown:

   ![](images/050Linux/29.1.PNG)

- Click **Create**

In less than one minute, you should see your instance provisioning and the IP Address.  While it's spinning up, you'll notice the OCID has been generated.  This can be used to refer to this image using the REST API should you want to.

![](images/050Linux/30.1.PNG)

- `Make a note of the IP Address as we will be using this in the next step.`

In about 2 1/2 minutes, you should see your instance in the running state, available to be reached via ssh.

   ![](images/050Linux/30.2.PNG)


### **STEP 9**: SSH into the Instance and install Docker

The last set up piece will be to SSH into the Compute image and install packer and git.

- For a Windows client session bring up Putty, select the **Session** section and type in the IP address:

   ![](images/050Linux/31.PNG)

- Select the **Data** section and enter the following as the username:

```
opc
```

- Screenshot:

  ![](images/050Linux/32.PNG)

- Select **SSH-->Auth** and browse to the Private Key you created back in Step 7:

   ![](images/050Linux/33.PNG)

- Click the **Open** button. You will presented the first time with am alert message. Click **Yes**

   ![](images/050Linux/35.PNG)

- You will logged into the Compute image:

   ![](images/050Linux/36.PNG)

- **NOTE:** For Linux and Mac client sessions "cd" into the directory where your key pair is. Your packerkey file has the permissions of "600" or "rw---------".  The private key allows you to ssh into the compute instance `substituting your IP address`, which already has the public key we specified in the instance create...deployed to the opc user.

Example:

```
ssh -i ./packerkey opc@129.213.56.230
```

### **STEP 10**: Install and configure Docker and GIT

Docker and GIT are required for the subsuquent labs. You will install the Docker engine, enable it to start on re-boot, grant docker privledges to the `opc` user and finally install GIT.

- **Type** the following in the term:

```
sudo -s
mkdir packer
cd packer
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.3.4/packer_1.3.4_linux_amd64.zip
unzip packer_1.3.4_linux_amd64.zip /usr/local/bin
alias packer=/usr/local/bin/packer
```

- **NOTE:** During the `yum install docker-engine` command press `Y` is asked if installation is ok.

- Screenshot at the end of the Docker installation:

   ![](images/050Linux/38.PNG)

   ![](images/050Linux/39.PNG)

- **Type** the following:

```
yum install git
```

- Screenshot at the end of the GIT installation:

   ![](images/050Linux/40.PNG)

- **Type** the following to verify good installations:

```
su - opc
docker version
docker images
git --version
```

   ![](images/050Linux/41.PNG)

### **STEP 11**: Edit /etc/sysconfig/selinux

Set the server to Permissive mode and also ensure that permissive mode survives re-boots by editing `/etc/sysconfig/selinux`

- Using vi, change the SELINUX line to **permissive**. **Type** the following: (**NOTE**: You need to be the root user to edit this file)

```
sudo -s
vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux
```

- **NOTE:** If new to vi, press the letter `i` to edit text. To save press Escape, the type `:wq!`.

   ![](images/050Linux/42.PNG)

- Save the file and exit out of vi

- Now, **Type** the following:

```
setenforce 0
sestatus
```

- Verify that your server is in permissive mode.

   ![](images/050Linux/43.PNG)

- **Type** the following to exit out of `root` and go back and verify that you're now the `opc` user:

```
exit
whoami
```
