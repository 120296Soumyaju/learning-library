# Packer Workshop - Using Packer:  First Build

![](images/WorkshopHeader/300.png)

## Introduction

In this lab we introduce the basics of packer. The goal will be to create your first image given your a basic idea of the workflow.

## Objectives

- Create your first packer-built image
- Understand base images and their use in OCI and packer

## Required Artifacts

- Oracle Cloud Account - (configured in Lab100)
- Your Compute Client Image (from lab 200) or packer & git installed locally on your laptop.
- Your API Keypair (pem files)
- Your git repository with the _variables_ file committed in JSON format.

### **STEP 1**: Locate your working directory

You cloned your github repository to your client (compute image or laptop)  This will download your work this far (OCIDs in your _variables_ file) so you don't have to edit

- In your ssh session, cd to the packer directory and clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/<yourGitHubUsername>/packer-oci
```

- You should see:

Check your _variables_ file to make sure the local repository is correctly cloned.

- Change directory to our packer scripts by typing:
`cd packer-oci/workshops/packer-oci/packer_scripts`

- Then type `more <variables file>`

- Verify that you have the private key for the cloud. Type **more ~/.oci/packer_api_key_public.pem** in your terminal window

```
more ~/.oci/packer_api_key_public.pem
```

### **STEP 2**: Run Packer validate

Packer has fairly simple features, build and validate.  Let's validate that your packerfile is correct with,
packer validate -var-file=_variables_.json _packerfile_.json.  For example, since Padma used PadmaD.json in her GitHub, she would **type**

```
packer validate -var-file=PadmaD.json  varBuild300.json
```

### **STEP 3**: Run Packer Build

This is where it starts to get good, you've got the setup all done and can now build.

Build with the validated packerfile, packer build -var-file=_variables_.json  _packerfile_.json

```
packer build -var-file=PadmaD.json  varBuild300.json
```

- View your custom image by navigating to **Compute -> Custom Images**

  ![](images/Lab300/6.png)

Success! Our image has completed the build process and is available to be launched as an OCI instance.  We will do that in both lab 400 and 500, so to complete this lab, just make note of the OCID and that you will see that it matches the output of Step 3's "packer build"

- Click **Show** to view the OCID

- You'll see that the OCID is the same:

**You are ready to proceed to [Lab 400](Lab400.md)**
