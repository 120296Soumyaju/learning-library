# Lab 100: Building nodejs App with ATP

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to get started using the Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing on Oracle Infrastructure Cloud (OCI). You will build a node.js app with ATP.

To **log issues**, click [here](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/issues/new) to go to the github oracle repository issue submission form.

## Objectives

- Log into ATP and download credentials
- Install and configure node.js 
- Run node.js to test connectivity to ATP

## Required Artifacts

-   The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.
- Install node.js on your laptop
- Install Oracle instant client 12.2
- Download and unzip ATP secure connectivity file
- Install oracledb node driver 

## Steps

### STEP 1: Sign in to Oracle Cloud and Download credentials**

-   Go to [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com), click **Sign In** to sign in with your Oracle Cloud account.

- On the admin screen download the credentials 

![](./images/100/Picture100-downcreds.jpeg)

- Provide the passphrase to download the credentials zip file, note the passphrase it is needed to open the zip file

- Download and Install appropriate node.js on you laptop from the following [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### STEP 3: Download and Install node.js
- From Node.js website download and install mac OS package. Once the installation is complete, verify node and npm version.

- Check the node and npm version 
```
node —version
```
```
npm —version
```

### STEP 4: Download and install Oracle Instant Client
- Download and unzip Oracle Instant Client for Mac OS from the [link](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/intel-macsoft-096467.html)

![](./images/100/Picture100-Oracleinstallclient.jpeg)

- On the download page accept license agreement and download instantclient-basic-macos.x64-12.2.0.1.0-2.zip

- Once downloaded, Unzip the instant client in folder of your choice and add it to your path variable.
```
export PATH-=$PATH:/path_to_instant_client_12.2
```

- Create soft link to libclntsh.dylib.12.1 in either /usr/local/lib or in ~/lib.

```
ls -s ~/Downloads/instantclient_12_2/ libclntsh.dylib.12.1 /usr/local/lib
```

- Now that the instant client is setup lets move on Download the credentials file from Admin console. We have pre-provisioned Oracle ATP that we are going to use for our node application.

### STEP 5: Setup environment variables for ATP connections
- Paste Downloaded Credentials zip file here

- Once the file has been downloaded, go and unzip the file in node application folder.

- Unzip the downloaded wallet to file location of where the node app will be installed

- Set up TNS_ADMIN environment variable and point to the database wallet folder.

```
export TNS_ADMIN=/<path_to_unzipped_wallet_folder>
```
![](./images/100/Picture100-tnsadminexport.jpeg)


- In wallet_ATPTEJUS, you will need to update certain files. Open the wallet files in a text editor.

    * Open ojdbc.properties file and make sure DIRECTORY points to TNS_ADMIN which we set up earlier.
    * Open sqlnet.ora and set up DIRECTORY to TNS_ADMIN

    ```
    WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = file) (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY=${TNS_ADMIN})))
    SSL_SERVER_DN_MATCH=yes
    ```

### STEP 6: Configure and start your Node.js App

- You can download the files from /scripts/dbconfig.js and /scripts/server.js and copy it to your node project folder.

- Server.js is the application we want to run and dbconfig.js has the database credentials.

- Open dbconfig.js in a text editor and make the following changes:
    * dbuser: admin (your ATP user)
    * dbpassword: ATP admin user password
    * connectString: your_ATP_instance_name_high

![](./images/100/Picture100-dbconfig.jpeg)

- Let us now run server.js

```
node server.js
```

- You have successfully connected your node application to Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing.
