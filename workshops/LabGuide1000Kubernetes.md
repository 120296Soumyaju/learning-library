# Lab 1000: Using Kubernetes

## Introduction

A Kubernetes cluster is a group of nodes. The nodes are the machines running applications. Each node can be a physical machine or a virtual machine. The node's capacity (its number of CPUs and amount of memory) is defined when the node is created. A cluster can be organized into namespaces, to divide the cluster's resources between multiple uses.

- a master node (for high availability, typically there will actually be a number of master nodes)
- one or more worker nodes (sometimes known as minions)

The master node in a cluster runs a number of processes:

- kube-apiserver to support API operations via the Kubernetes command line tool (kubectl) and the REST API, and includes admissions controllers required for advanced Kubernetes operations
- kube-controller-manager to manage different Kubernetes components (for example, replication controller, endpoints controller, namespace controller, and serviceaccounts controller)
- kube-scheduler to control where in the cluster to run jobs
- etcd to store the cluster's configuration data

Each worker node runs two Kubernetes processes:

- kubelet to communicate with the master node
- kube-proxy to handle networking

Each worker node also runs the Docker runtime.

## Objectives

- To build a Kubernetes cluster in the Oracle Cloud running a node.js application
- Connect Node.js application to an ATP Database service running in the Oracle cloud

## Required Artifacts

-   The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.
- Docker installed on your local machine. If you do not have docker please follow this [Mac User link](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/), [Windows User link](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) and install docker

## Steps

### **STEP 1: Pull the image and Setup OCI**

- First we will pull down the docker image using:


```
docker pull [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG|@DIGEST]
```

- Second, we will create a directory which we will use later to place our wallet in. When running our docker image we will use the -v option to map the directory to the image and the image will be able to pick up the wallet information

```
mkdir -p ~/tmp/wallet
```

- Now we will launch the container using the image we just pulled.

Note: With this run command we are mapping the local directory ~/tmp/wallet/ to the directory in the image /opt/oracle/database/wallet

```
docker run -it -v ~/tmp/wallet:/opt/oracle/database/wallet -p 3050:3050 NAMEOFIMAGE sh
```

- Once in the image we will setup OCI-CLI like we did in Lab900:

```
oci setup config
```

- Follow the prompts supplying the proper information:

- Add the public key generated in the container to the public keys in your User's list:

### **STEP 2: Deploy the Infratstructure**

- This step is entirely automated and only requires the user to add the compartment ID to deploy the infrastructure

```
./deployInfra.sh
```

- This will prompt you to enter the compartment ID of which to deploy the infrastructure. You can watch as everything is automatically setup for you

This process can take upwards of 10 minutes while everything is configured
