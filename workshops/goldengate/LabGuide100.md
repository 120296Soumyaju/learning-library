## Introduction

This is the first of several labs that are part of the Oracle Public Cloud GoldenGate Cloud Service workshop. These labs will give you a basic understanding of the Oracle GoldenGate Cloud Service and many of the capabilities around real time data replication and migration.  Throughout the workshop the following use cases will be covered in more detail in the following labs.  In lab 400 you will review GGCS monitoring.  Lab 500 covers the use case replication of data from a DBCS 12c Multi-tenant database (cloud) to an 11g on-premise database (optional lab).

- Lab 200: Zero downtime migration and replication of data from an on-premise 11g database to a DBCS 12c multi-tenant database use case.

- Lab 300: Replication and transformation of data from a DBCS 12c pluggable database to a DBCS 12c reporting data warehouse with Business Intelligence analytics access use case.

## Objectives

- Walk through the steps to create a GoldenGate Cloud Service that will manage data replication between on-premise and cloud environments, and manage replication between different cloud environments.
- Familiarize you with the Oracle Cloud environment and services that will be used in the following labs.

## Required Artifacts

- As noted in the readme, you will be accessing several Oracle Cloud Services throughout the labs. We have prepared a ***one-page GoldenGate Cloud Services Workshop handout*** with the required information.  

### **STEP 1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud account and Review Services

- Open a Browser and log into [cloud.oracle.com](cloud.oracle.com):

	https://cloud.oracle.com

- Click **Sign In** in the upper right hand corner of the browser

	![](images/100/i5.png)

- **IMPORTANT** - Under my services, select Traditional Cloud Account from the drop down list, and the correct data center (Region) and click on **My Services**. Review your handout fields ***CS4*** for your assigned Cloud Service Region/Data Center information.

- Next enter the **identity domain** (***CS1*** in your handout) and click **Go**

	![](images/100/i7.png)

- Once your Identity Domain is set, enter your User Name (***CS2***)and Password (***CS3***) and click **Sign In**

	![](images/100/i8.png)

- You will be presented with a Dashboard summarizing all of your available services.  You have access to several services, but only Database and Compute are visible.  **Click** on **Customize Dashboard** to add GoldenGate to your list of visible services. 

	![](images/100/i9.png)

- You can then add services to the dashboard by clicking **Show**. If you do not want to see a specific service click **Hide**.

### **STEP 2**: Create GoldenGate Cloud Service Instance

- Select GoldenGate Service and then console.

 	![](images/100/i20.2.png)

- Open Service Console, and then Create Service Instance.  Note first time you select GoldenGate you get a welcome page - select the 'Go to Console' link on this welcome page.  Screen shot below does not show the welcome page, but shows what you see after the first access.

### **STEP 3**: Review GGCS Instance

- A GoldenGate Cloud Service has already been created for you.  The one you created above should take about 15 minutes, but will not be used.  

- Go to the GoldenGate console to get the IP address.  Select GoldenGate.

	![](images/100/i28.png)

- Open Service Console.

	![](images/100/i28.1.png)

- Open `ggcsservice-ggcs-1`

	![](images/100/i29.png)

- Note the public IP **this is field ***GG1*** on your handout**.  You will need this later for various configuration steps.
