This workshop will walk you through replacation of data from a DBCS 12c Pluggable database to another DBCS 12c Pluggable database.  This lab will introduce data transformations as part of the replication process, and will show how you can deliver real-time analytics through Oracle Business Intelligence data visualizations and dashboards.
