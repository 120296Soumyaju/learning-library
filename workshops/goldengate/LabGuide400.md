## Introduction

This is the fourth of five GoldenGate Cloud Service labs, and covers the third use case: Replication and transformation of data from a DBCS 12c pluggable database to a DBCS 12c reporting data warehouse with Business Intelligence analytics access.

![](images/100/i4.png)

This workshop will walk you through replacation of data from a DBCS 12c Pluggable database to another DBCS 12c Pluggable database.  This lab will introduce data transformations as part of the replication process, and will show how you can deliver real-time analytics through Oracle Business Intelligence data visualizations and dashboards.

To log issues and view the lab guide source, go to the [github oracle](https://github.com/pcdavies/GoldenGateCloudService/tree/master/workshops/goldengate/issues) repository.

## Objectives

- Configure GGCS extract and replicat processes for data replication between DBCS 12c Pluggable Databases.
- Process data transformations as part of the data replication process.
- Review auditing support for before/after image (record) capture.
- Show how real time data replication supports real time analytics and reporting.

## Required Artifacts

- Access to your Oracle Cloud account and services DBCS, GGCS, Compute, and BI Cloud Service (BICS).

### **STEP 1**: Configure GoldenGate Cloud Service (GGCS)

- Open a terminal window on the OGG Compute image and ssh to GGCS:
	- **SSH to GGCS:** `ssh -i /home/oracle/Desktop/GGCS_Workshop_Material/keys/ggcs_key opc@<your ggcs IP address>`
	- **Switch to user oracle:** `sudo su - oracle`
    - **Switch to GGHOME:** `cd $GGHOME`
	- **Start a gg command shell:** `ggsci`

- View extract and replicat configuration.  Note we are configuring both extract (source) and replicat (target) in on oby file.  Note the use of two different credentials.
    - **Enter the following:** `view param dirprm/ADD_DW_ALL.oby`  Read comments

    ![](images/400/i2.png)

- Create/add extract and replicat processes.
    - **Enter the following:** `obey dirprm/ADD_DW_ALL.oby`

    ![](images/400/i3.png)

- Review processes.
    - **Enter the following:** `info all`

    ![](images/400/i4.png)

- Stop Lab 300 processes and start new DW (Lab 400) processes.
    - **Stop EAMER:** `stop EAMER`
    - **Stop PAMER:** `stop PAMER`
    - **Start DW Processes:** `start *DW`
    - **Review results:** `info all`

### **STEP 2**: Generate Insert Transactions and Review Data on Source and Target

- Start SQLDeveloper and run script `generate_dw_data.sql` to generate insert transactions.  Open the script.
 
    ![](images/400/i6.png)

- Run `generate_dw_data.sql` against Amer

    ![](images/400/i7.png)

- Review results.  Scroll up and down to see all stats.
    - **Enter the following in ggsci:** `stats *DW total`

    ![](images/400/i8.png)

- Review results.  Run `get_dw_count.sql` and show that counts match.  Open the script.

    ![](images/400/i9.png)

- Run `get_dw_count.sql` against amer.

    ![](images/400/i10.png)

- Browse the following tables in SQLDeveloper to compare AMER and DW tables to see that the following transformations occurred.  **NO DETAILED SCREEN SHOTS**.
- **CUSTOMERS:** `CUSTOMERS_FIRSTNAME` and `CUSTOMERS_LASTNAME` concatenated into `CUSTOMERS_NAME` column.
- **CUSTOMERS:** mail address stripped out and only domain mapped into `CUSTOMER_EMAIL_DOMAIN` column.
- **ORDERS:** split into `CREDIT_ORDERS` and `NON_CREDIT_ORDERS` tables based on content of  `PAYMENT_METHOD` column.
- **ORDERS:** `ORDERS_STATUS_DESC` column filled in by SQL lookup of value from `ORDERS_STATUS_LOOKUP` table.
- **ORDERS_PRODUCTS:** `FINAL_PRICE` column calculated via stored procedure (they can look at the stored procedure `DW.SP_TOTAL` via GUI if desired)
- **PRODUCTS:**  `PRODUCTS_TAX_CLASS_DESC` column filled in by using case statement
- **PRODUCTS_HISTORY** auditing table populated by inserting all records (note additional columns).

### **STEP 3**: Review Audit Support

- Review `PRODUCTS_HISTORY` in `DW` auditing table to see that updates include the BEFORE and AFTER images of updates.

### **STEP 4**: Access BICS Dashboards and Review GGCS Replicated Data
