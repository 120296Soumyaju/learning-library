## IMPORTANT: How to prepare for this workshop

**Get an Oracle Cloud Account** 
- Oracle provides several methods for gaining access to Oracle Cloud Accounts used to complete the Labs in this Hands-on-Workshop. 
    - For some workshop events, cloud environments will be provided. 
    - For others events (e.g. **Oracle Code**), or when completing this workshop in a self-service model, you must gain access to your own Trial account. Trial accounts can be obtained at [Try It](http://cloud.oracle.com/tryit) 
    - If you are attending an Oracle sponsored event, please **review your Event invitation** for more instruction on how to gain access to your Workshop Account.

## Oracle GoldenGate Cloud Services Workshop

This Oracle Public Cloud GoldenGate Cloud Services workshop will give you a basic understanding of the Oracle GoldenGate Cloud Service and many of the capabilities around real time data replication and migration.  Three use cases will be covered.  The first will walk you through setting up zero downtime migration with one-way replication between an Oracle 11g database and a DBCS 12c database.  The second lab will show you how to configure GGCS to perform one-way DML and DDL replication between a DBCS 12c database and an on-prem Oracle 11g database.  The third lab is designed to configure GGCS to replicate data between two DBCS 12c Pluggable Databases with data transformations, and show BICS dashboards against replicated data.  Lastly you will review GGCS monitoring services.


## Workshop Details

**Reference the following Lab Guides by opening their Documentation Files:**

## Lab 100: Introduction to GoldenGate Cloud Service

**Documentation**: [LabGuide100.md](LabGuide100.md)

### Objectives

- Familiarize you with the Oracle Cloud environment and services that will be used in the following labs.
- Familiarize you with an on-premise 11g Database environment that will be replicated to a DBCS 12c environment.  Note: this is set up as an image running in Oracle IAAS/compute, but process and configuration steps are the same as though the image was running outside the cloud.
- Walk through the steps to create a GoldenGate Cloud Service that will manage data replication between on-premise and cloud environments, and manage replication between different cloud environments.
- Walk you through creating a new GoldenGate enabled Database Cloud Service.
- To log issues and view the Lab Guide source, go to the [github oracle](https://github.com/pcdavies/GoldenGateCloudService/tree/master/workshops/goldengate) repository.

## Lab 200: On-Premise to Cloud Zero Downtime Migration

**Documentation**: [LabGuide200.md](LabGuide200.md)

### Objectives

- Configure SQLDeveloper to access the source and target databases.
- Use Oracle Datapump to migrate data from 11g on-premise to DBCS 12c.
- Configure an on-premise GoldenGate to extract data from a 11g Database.
- Configure GoldenGate Cloud Service to replicate data to a DBCS 12c Pluggable Database.
- Generate transactions to showcase real time data replication, while tracking data consistency between environments.

## Lab 300: Cloud to On-Premise Replication with DDL

**Documentation**: [LabGuide300.md](LabGuide300.md)

### Objectives

- Configure GGCS extract processes for data replication to 11g Database on-premise.
- Configure OGG replicat processes for data replication from DBCS 12c in the Cloud.
- Generate Transactions and view data movement statistics to monitor activity.

## Lab 400: Cloud to Cloud Replication with Transformations and Real Time BI Analytics

**Documentation**: [LabGuide400.md](LabGuide400.md)

### Objectives

- Configure GGCS extract and replicat processes for data replication between DBCS 12c Pluggable Databases.
- Process data transformations as part of the data replication process.
- Review auditing support for before/after image (record) capture.
- Show how real time data replication supports real time analytics and reporting.

## Lab 500: GoldenGate Cloud Service Monitoring

**Documentation**: [LabGuide500.md](LabGuide500.md)

### Objectives

- Configure GGCS for monitoring.
- Start monitoring services and review activity.
