Update: December 7, 2017

## Workshop Introduction

This Oracle Public Cloud DevOps and Cloud Native Microservices workshop will walk you through the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for a Cloud Native project, during which you will create and use several Microservices. During this workshop you will take on the role of 4 personae. As the first persona - the Project Manager - you will create the projects, add tasks and features to be worked on, and assign tasks to developers.  The Project Manager will then start the initial sprint. The Java Developer persona will develop a new twitter feed microservice that will allow for retrieval and filtering of twitter data. The Full Stack Developer persona will develop a new database microservice that allows access to the product catalog data. The JavaScript Developer persona will make enhancements to the Product Catalog UI that will display the twitter data related to a select catalog item.  During the workshop, you will get exposure to Oracle Developer Cloud Service and Oracle Application Container Cloud Service.

## _Install Open Source Tools_

## Java JDK

### **Step 5 (Windows Option)**: JDK Verification on Windows

**Note**: Eclipse requires that you have the a Java JDK 8 installed. Even if you have a JRE version 8, you still need to verify that you have a JDK 8 installed.

- On Windows, open a **cmd** window and enter `java -version`

```
C:\Users\usr>java -version
java version "1.8.0_121"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode, sharing)
```

- If JDK/**Java version 1.8** is not installed,  you will need to download a [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) from the Oracle Technology Network website, and install.

### **Step 6 (Mac Option)**: JDK Verification on a MAC

**Note**: Eclipse requires that you have the a Java **JDK** 8 installed. Even if you have a **JRE** version 8, you still need to verify that you have a JDK 8 installed.

- Open Terminal window and execute the following command:

```
ls /Library/java/JavaVirtualMachines/
```

- If you do not have a JDK 1.8 folder, you will need to download the [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) from the Oracle Technology Network website, and install.

## Eclipse

### **Step 7**: Download Eclipse

***Note***: Even if you already have Eclipse installed, you need to install and use the version documented below. This version of Eclipse contains the ***Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse***, which will be used during the workshop.

- Go to the [Eclipse](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/eclipse/downloads/index.html) installation website

- Accept the **licensing agreement**, and then select the **Neon** version of Eclipse required for your operating system.

    ![](images/studentguide/Picture1.png)

- Once you've downloaded eclipse, extract the zip file and install. ***Note:*** If you encounter an error when extracting Eclipse due to a "Path name too long" error on Windows, there are solutions that can be found by performing an internet search on the error to change the Windows allowed file length. Also, we have found that using the open source [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) tool can help overcome the file length errors encountered by the default windows zip file extraction tools.

### **Step 8**: Optionally Configure Proxies (if behind a firewall)

If you are running Eclipse behind a firewall, you need to configure the proxy setting. First, you need to ensure that Eclipse's proxy is set. Next, you need to update the maven proxy setting, and then finally, you need to ensure that the Oracle Plugin will work with your proxy settings.

- To set configure Eclipse's proxy, open Eclipse and navigate to the Properties menu. Depending on the operating system, this drop down is found either from the **Eclipse > Preferences, or Window > Preferences**

    ![](images/studentguide/Picture2.png)

- From the preferences panel, enter "**proxy**" into the search window, and click on **Network Connections**. Select **Native** for the Active Provider and click on **OK**. This setting works well, but it requires that you have the proxy setting configured correctly on the system running Eclipse â€“ e.g. Windows, MAC OS or Linux. Selecting Manual should also work, but some of the plugins require the underlying operating system's proxy to be configured.

    ![](images/studentguide/Picture3.png)

- To test that your connection works, select the menu option **Window > Show View > Other**

    ![](images/studentguide/Picture4.png)

- Type _web_ in the search field, select **Internal Web Browser** and click on **OK**

    ![](images/studentguide/Picture5.png)

- Enter a **URL** into the browser and press **enter** to test your proxy settings.

![](images/studentguide/Picture6.png)

### **Step 9**: Optionally Update the Eclipse / Maven proxy (if behind a firewall)

***Note:*** You will only do this optional Eclipse/Maven Proxy setup if you are behind a firewall. Otherwise, skip this step, and go to next step where you will download and install Brackets.

- From the **Eclipse > Preference or Window > Preferences** panel, type **Maven** into the search box.
- Click on the Maven **User Settings**. Make note of the directory where the settings.xml file is to be located. In the example below, the Maven User Settings will be located in the **/home/oracle/.m2** directory

    ![](images/studentguide/Picture7.png)

- **Cancel** out of the Maven dialog, and **Close** Eclipse

- If the directory does not exist where the settings.xml file is to be located, **create the directory**. In this example, we will create the **.m2** directory.

- Also, create the **settings.xml** file, if it does not exist. Add the following to the settings.xml file (NOTE: you will need to use your correct **Host, Port, nonProxyHosts, username and Password settings**):

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.1.0.xsd">
<proxies>
<proxy>
<active>true</active>
<protocol>http</protocol>
<username>proxyuser</username>
<password>proxypass</password>
<host>www-proxy.us.oracle.com</host>
<port>80</port>
<nonProxyHosts>local.net|some.host.com</nonProxyHosts>
</proxy>
<proxy>
<active>true</active>
<protocol>https</protocol>
<username>proxyuser</username>
<password>proxypass</password>
<host>www-proxy.us.oracle.com</host>
<port>80</port>
<nonProxyHosts>local.net|some.host.com</nonProxyHosts>
</proxy>
</proxies>
</settings>
```

- Reload Eclipse to use the new maven settings
