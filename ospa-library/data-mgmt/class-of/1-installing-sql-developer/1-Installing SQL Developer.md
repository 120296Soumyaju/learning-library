Oracle SQL Developer is a free, integrated development environment that
simplifies the development and management of Oracle Database in both traditional
and Cloud deployments. SQL Developer offers a worksheet for running queries and
scripts, a DBA console for managing the database, a reports interface, a
complete data modelling solution, and a migration platform for moving your 3rd
party databases to Oracle. 

The labs make extensive use of SQL Developer, so you need to install it on your
computer as a pre-requisite.
