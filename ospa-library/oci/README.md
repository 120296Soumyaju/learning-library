# OSPA - OCI Hands On Lab Repository

[OCI Overview Lab](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/tree/master/ospa-library/oci/oci-overview)
- This lab will introduce you to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service.  We will be creating a virtual cloud network, compute instances, and block storage.  Then we will install and configure Docker containers on the compute instance.   This lab is designed to be a simple introduction to many of the services you will use in the design of a customer solution and to familiarize you with those services.

[OCI Basics Workshop](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/tree/master/ospa-library/oci/OCI-Basics-Workshop)
- Workshop that will introduce a new learner to the basics of OCI.  Similar to the above workshop but in this lab we'll walk the learner through launching a developer instance, creating block storage, then un-mounting the storage and mounting on a different instance.   This workshop also includes a section on how to create and use SSH keys for the major desktop platforms.
