# **BETA** Scripts to convert .docx to .md **BETA**

### Ale is working on a couple of Python scripts - NOTE: Currently BETA!
* One for Python 2  [converter_beta.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjking2019/ospa-github-ideas/master/files/converter_beta.py)
* One for Python 3  [converter_py37.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjking2019/ospa-github-ideas/master/files/converter_py37.py)

### How do I know which version of Python I have on my machine? (you might have both)

1. Open Terminal window on Mac; Command window on Windows (__"cmd" command__ NOT "command")

1. Issue following command to see if you are on python 2

   `python --version`

1. Issue following command to see if you are on python 3

   `python3 --version`

### Run the appropriate command from the command line

   `python converter_beta.py`

   `python3 converter_py37.py`

 ### You will see a dialog that looks like this:

1. Use 'Browse' complete file path to docx file<br/>
   (we're working on a version that lets you 'browse')
   
   Windows
    (C:\Users\Manatee\Documents\mymswordfile.docx)
   
   Mac/Linux
    (/Users/Manatee/Document/mymswordfile.docx)

1. Use 'Browse' to fill in path for local git repo
   (presumes you have 'cloned' Dev Repo)

   C:\Users\Manatee\gitrepos\AppDev   (Windows)<br/>
   /Users/Manatee/gitrepos/AppDev     (Mac/Linux  )

### The original .docx file will now be found in your local repository converted to .md with all GitHub formatting

* Mac users\ still need to change all .tiff images to .png or .jpg that GitHub will recognize (batch tools work best) and modify the .md file to change the image suffixes from .tiff to .png or .jpg (whatever you created)

* Now you are ready to clean-up the document as desired
