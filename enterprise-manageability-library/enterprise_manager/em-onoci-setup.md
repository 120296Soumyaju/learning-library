Purpose 
========

In this Workshop you will learn how to create a Compute Instance utilizing the Oracle
Enterprise Manager (EM) image from the Oracle Cloud marketplace. The Enterprise
Manager instance you instantiate includes a pre-configured Enterprise Manager,
repository and Oracle Database targets.

After you have completed this HOL, you can then move on and complete other Hands
on Labs using the EM environment instance.

GOAL
====

Without having to wait for an available host to be setup on-premise, in minutes
gaining access to a configured and running Oracle Enterprise Manager environment
to learn it capabilities and functionalities hand on. Better understand how
Oracle Cloud can be utilized in day to day duties and business problem solving.

==================================================================

Oracle Cloud Prerequisites 
==========================
1.  An OCI administrator has setup an Oracle Cloud Compartment and Virtual Cloud Network for this activity.
2.  The Virtual Cloud Network's ingress rules have been enabled for the Enterprise Manager Workshop.
3.  Each participant has a SSH public/private key-pair to Create/Login to your OCI instance.

How To Create a Compute Instance
================================

1.  Access the published image from the Oracle Marketplace. For example
    <https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/listing/69658839>

	![](media/d473f092c096c48e417fc9f72560fa1b.jpg)

2.  **Click** on the Get App button

3.  **Select** the nearest or most appropriate Oracle Cloud Region and **Click**
    the Sign In button  
      
    

    ![](media/29ba466907f3a2f7590498a5140b6be7.jpg)

4.  Login to your tenancy using your account USER NAME and PASSWORD  
      
    

    ![](media/702bbd73597e664e613283214f4425bb.png)

5.  After login, Select the compartment you want the image in by clicking the
    **Compartment** drop down menu and selecting the *compartment_name*.

	> NOTE: do NOT use the root compartment. Choose the compartment your company Cloud Administrator setup for you or use one you created for the image. (example TEST)

1.  **Click** the check box for reviewing and accepting the Oracle Standard
    Terms and Restrictions and then **Click** on the **Launch Instance** button

	![](media/72aa027215ecd6d8688518bc5a6c8028.jpg)

1.  When the Create Compute Instance dialog appears, **enter** a unique name you
    desire to identify this instance. For example: *your first name*\_em_handson
    and not what is shown in the screenshot.  
      
    

    ![](media/b4cec3edc37e987684bdb12418bca9ee.jpg)

2.  Verify the image source you want is selected (in this example Enterprise
    Manager 13c Workshop), then **Click Show Shape, Network,** and **Storage
    Options** if hidden.

1.  After which, it’s recommended to balance instances across Availability
    Domains AD which also helps with any tenancy limits; especially if there are
    multiple users using the tenancy at the same time to get hands on experience
    with the image.

	> NOTE: when there are many users, if your last name is A-J, **select AD1**,J-M, **select AD2**, and if it’s N-Z, **select AD3**.

1.  For the **Instance Type**, select Virtual Machine and select the **Change
    Shape** button.

	![](media/29d37c3d72579612ebaf96bbf58e5dd9.png)

1.  When presented with the Browse All Shapes choices, verify that the
    VMStandard2.4 (4 OCPU and 60 GB memory) shape is checked.

	![](media/bae52a344e8a9ec62c69e14a7b8f9faf.png)

	> NOTE: VMStandard2.2 may be used if VM.Standard2.4 is not available
	![](media/6c656ee35c9ba15e0ce28ad1e997674b.tiff)

1.  After the **AD**, **Instance Type** and **Instance Shape** have been set,
    the next step is to configure the networking section.

1.  For the Virtual Cloud Network Compartment and Subnet compartment, verify the
    **compartment_name** chosen is the same as in step 5. For the Virtual Cloud
    Network, verify you have the VCN identified that you created with ingress
    rules for the EM image.

	![](media/dc10fbf5cc961dad2eb7b30905783f6b.jpg)

1.  Verify the **Assign a public IP address** radio button is selected. DO NOT
    OVERLOOK THIS STEP!!!!!!!

1.  Leave the **Default boot volume size** as is and do NOT check any additional
    settings.

	![](media/90e20e7c685753daba9d02fec5e667ae.png)



1.  Dependent on how you generated and saved your Public SSH Key (refer to
    Frequently Asked Questions covering how to obtain an SSH key), select the
    Choose SSH key file or Paste SSH keys radio button and complete the
    associated action.

	![](media/9af0df3609eff883efbf6fd9eaed6770.png)


1.  Next **Click** the **Create** button for your instance to be created.
    Dependent on how many are using a tenancy, you will see the yellow
    provisioning state take about \~4 minutes and \~ 20 mins for startup of the
    databases and Enterprise Manager within your VM.

2.  You can view the Work Requests section towards the bottom, for status
    information of your instance.

	![](media/c40bc02fea2a3ea8ef76164a3d20dfad.png)

1.  Once the instance is in the green running state, locate your **public IP
    address** and write it down as it will be essential to have it later.

	![](media/f53935f66cb9b633460df11bdaa2c634.png)

	> NOTE: that as part of this pre-configured image, all Enterprise Manager services automatically start up so you do not have to separately start up the OMS, etc… via EMCTL or scripts

1. After the services are running, access Enterprise Manager to verify access
    to it by using this URL format in your browser (Chrome is suggested)

	> NOTE: Don’t be **alarmed if you see a** certification warning like this.

	![](media/d3f4e747ac10504d20950d505a45e7c6.png)

1.  It is safe to ignore it that and move ahead. Click on the **Advanced**
    button and then click on the **Accept the Risk and Continue** button.

	> NOTE: if you receive a Cannot Connect screen, wait a few more minutes for the image to complete its startup and then try again. You should then see the Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 13c login screen.  

	You now have an Oracle Cloud container with a running Oracle Enterprise Manager environment.

	>NOTE: when your environment is not in use, it is recommended that it be shutdown to minimize billing use or trial credit charges.

Get To Know The Preconfigured Environment<br>
===============================================

In this HOL example, the image used was a pre-configured environment of Oracle
Enterprise Manager 13.3 with databases and targets all running within a single
Virtual Machine. Oracle Cloud Marketplace is routinely updated with new product
images and versions.

Named Credentials Secured by Best Practice
------------------------------------------

Target credentials are stored within Enterprise Manager as "named" entities.
Administrators can define and store credentials within Enterprise Manager and
refer to the credential by a credential name.

If only a specific DBA is to have knowledge of higher privileged credentials
like *SYS* credentials for a database, they can store such credentials in a
named credential and then share that name with other users/administrators who
need privileged access to use them. Standard users are able to perform their
jobs using the named credentials without knowing what the actual credentials
are.

If administrators have the same credentials for targets, they can create one
named credential containing those credentials and share the name with
appropriate personnel. That simplifies credential maintenance (changing
passwords, for example) by eliminating the need to create several copies of
named credentials containing the same credentials.

These named credentials are already defined in the Oracle Cloud Marketplace EM
image instance.

| Credential Name | Credential Owner | Authenticating Target Type | CRedential Type      | Target name                  | Target Username |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| CDB186_SYS      | SYSMAN           | Database Instance          | Database Credentials | cdb186.subnet.vcn.oracle.com | sys             |
| OEM_SYS         | SYSMAN           | Database Instance          | Database Credentials |                              | sys             |
| ORACLE          | SYSMAN           | Host                       | Host Credentials     | emcc.marketplace.com         | oracle          |
| ORACLE_HOST     | SYSMAN           | Host                       | Host Credentials     |                              | oracle          |

Database Target Inventory
-------------------------

These database targets are installed and setup in the Oracle Cloud Marketplace
EM image instance.
