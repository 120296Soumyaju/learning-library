### **Touch the Cloud Presentation Overview**:

During this presentation, we ask that you provide a brief summary of the Oracle Cloud Products you have investigated, and that you feel are of interest and relevance. You can find the information you need from Oracle's main [Cloud Home Page](https://cloud.oracle.com/) website. From this website you can investigate Oracle's three categories of Cloud Offerings: [Platform as a Service](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/paas), [Infrastructure as a Service](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/iaas) and [Software as a Service](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/saas). Note: The job for which you are applying will focus primarily on **Platform as a Service** and **Infrastructure as a Service**.  

### **Touch the Cloud Presentation Options**:

When providing your Oracle Cloud Product Presentation, you have two options. With both of these options, if you choose to use Powerpoint, please keep your presentation to 5 slides or less. 

- **Option 1** - Oracle Cloud Investigation and Demo:

    Acquire an Oracle Cloud Trial Account. More detail is provided below on how to acquire an [Oracle Trial](#Oracle-Trial-Account), but in summary, using an Oracle Trial account you can investigate any of the Oracle **Infrastructure** or **Platform** Cloud Services, and present what you learned about your experience and interest in these products. Many of Oracle's **Platform** Services (e.g: Application Container Cloud Service, Container Cloud Service, Developer Cloud Service, Oracle Database\/MSQL Cloud Services and Java Cloud Service provide simple demonstrations. Examples are also available using Oracle's **Infrastructure** Cloud Services. 

- **Option 2** - Oracle Cloud Investigation:

    As an option to getting a trial account, you can investigate the **Platform** and **Infrastructure** Services and present back some of your findings, understanding and interests.

# Oracle Trial Account

Acquiring and Oracle Account is not required for the interview, however, doing so will allow you to see first hand some of Oracle's cloud products before your interview. 

To get an Oracle Trial account, please go the [Oracle Try It](https://cloud.oracle.com/tryit). From this website you can find answers to your questions concerning the Free Trial account, along with step by step instructions on how to register your account. Some of the services you may desire to use require that your Account's Storage Replication policy is set prior to using those services being used.

Along with the instruction provided on the Oracle Webpage, you can Click on this [Video Link](https://publicdocs-corp.documents.us2.oraclecloud.com/documents/link/LD408AE98AE514A9D8A5B144F6C3FF17C1177E4725F3/fileview/D5BB8965F597992573C1B2A4F6C3FF17C1177E4725F3/_CloudCredits_VideoEdit.mp4) to view a short video showing how to acquire a trial account. 

**Note:** it may take 24 hours for your Trial to be approved/provisioned. 


## Configure Your Storage Replication Policy

Once your Trial Account is fully approved and provisioned, you will need to set your Storage Replication Policy. We recommend that you do this as soon as your account is fully provisioned, otherwise some of the PaaS services that may be of interest will not work correctly. The Replication Policy is not automatically set to allow for flexibility on how how it is configured.


### Login to your Oracle Cloud Account
- Using the link and credentials provided in your confirmation email, log into your Oracle Trial Account. 

- Once logged in, you will be presented with a Dashboard displaying the various cloud services available to your account.

If you do not want to see a specific service, click **Hide**
