During this section we ask that you provide a brief presentation on Oracle Cloud Products you have investigated, and that you feel are of interest and releveance.

Note: The job for which you are applying will focus primarily on **Platform as a Service** and **Infrastructure as a Service**.  

When providing your Oracle Cloud Product(s) Presentation, you have two options. With both of these options, if you choose to use Powerpoint, please keep your presentation to 5 slides or less.

Many of Oracle's **Platform** Services (e.g: Application Container Cloud Service, Container Cloud Servier, Developer Cloud Service, Database Cloud Services (Oracle and MySQL) and Java Cloud Service) provide simple demonstations. Example are also available using Oracle's **Infrastructure** Cloud Services.
