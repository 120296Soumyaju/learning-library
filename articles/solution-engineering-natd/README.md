## Overview Presentation

During this presentation, we ask that you provide a brief overview of yourself, including your technical experience and skills. It's not necessary to go into detail, as we will ask more questions during the [Technical Question and Answer Interview](#Technical-Question-and-Answer-Interview) section of the interview. 

<a name="Recent-Project-Presentation"></a>

## Recent Project Presentation

During this presentation, we would like you to provide an overview (or demonstration) of a development project on which you have recently worked. Provide examples of the technology, programming languages, and methodologies you used during this project. Feel free to use the whiteboard or laptop available in the interview room. If you use powerpoint, please keep your presentation to approximately 5 slides.  

## Touch the Cloud Presentation

![Touch The Cloud](../../common/images/Touch-the-Cloud.jpg)

<a name="Touch-the-Cloud-Presentation"></a>

### **Touch the Cloud Presentation Overview**:

During this presentation, we ask that you provide a brief summary of the Oracle Cloud Products you have investigated, and that you feel are of interest and relevance. You can find the information you need from Oracle's main [Cloud Home Page](https://cloud.oracle.com/) website. From this website you can investigate Oracle's three categories of Cloud Offerings: [Platform as a Service](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/paas), [Infrastructure as a Service](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/iaas) and [Software as a Service](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/saas). Note: The job for which you are applying will focus primarily on **Platform as a Service** and **Infrastructure as a Service**.  

### **Touch the Cloud Presentation Options**:

When providing your Oracle Cloud Product Presentation, you have two options. With both of these options, if you choose to use Powerpoint, please keep your presentation to 5 slides or less. 

- **Option 1** - Oracle Cloud Investigation and Demo:

    If you have an interest in acquiring an Oracle Trial account for a more in-depth Oracle Cloud investigation, details are provided below on the steps to acquire an [Oracle Trial](#Oracle-Trial-Account). Using an Oracle Trial account you can investigate any of the Oracle **Infrastructure** or **Platform** Cloud Services, and present what you learned about your experience and interest in these products. Many of Oracle's **Platform** Services (e.g: Application Container Cloud Service, Container Cloud Service, Developer Cloud Service, Oracle Database / MSQL Cloud Services and Java Cloud Service provide simple demonstrations. Examples are also available using Oracle's **Infrastructure** Cloud Services. 

- **Option 2** - Oracle Cloud Investigation:

    As an alternative to getting a Trial Account, you can investigate the **Platform** and **Infrastructure** Services and present back some of your findings and interests. You have flexibility in what you present. We are mostly interested in your understanding of the technical functionality of Oracle's Cloud Services, what you feel Oracle's Cloud capabilities are, and how they may compare to Oracle's competitor's solutions. We're not interested in a sales pitch, we're more interested in your technical understanding. 

<a name="Technical-Question-and-Answer-Interview"></a>

## Technical Question and Answer Interview

During this section of the interview we will ask technical questions based on your experience, and our requirements of the Solution Engineering position. We hope to gain a better understanding of your development expertise, your understanding of development methodologies, and your experience with various programming languages and open source tools and frameworks. 

<a name="Management-Interview"></a>

## Management Interview

During this section of the interview, you will meet with a member of the Solution Engineering leadership, during which time we hope to learn more about you and your interest in the Solution Engineering position at Oracle. 

<a name="Visual-Aids"></a>

## Visual Aids

- The interview room will be furnished with a whiteboard and laptop that you can use to present your [Recent Project](#Recent-Project-Presentation) and [Touch the Cloud](#Touch-the-Cloud-Presentation) Presentations.

<a name="Oracle-Trial-Account"></a>

# Oracle Trial Account

Acquiring an Oracle Account is not required for the interview, however, doing so will allow you to see first hand some of Oracle's cloud products before your interview. 

To get an Oracle Trial account, please go the [Oracle Try It](https://cloud.oracle.com/tryit). From this website you can find answers to your questions concerning the Free Trial account, along with step by step instructions on how to register your account. After your account is provisioned, some of the services you may desire to use require that your Account's Storage Replication policy is set prior to using those services. Those instructions are provided later in this guide.

## Configure Your Storage Replication Policy

Once your Trial Account is fully approved and provisioned, you will need to set your Storage Replication Policy. We recommend that you do this as soon as your account is fully provisioned, otherwise some of the PaaS services that may be of interest will not work correctly. The Replication Policy is not automatically set to allow for flexibility on how how it is configured.


### Login to your Oracle Cloud Account
- Using the link and credentials provided in your confirmation email, log into your Oracle Trial Account. 

- Once logged in, you will be presented with a Dashboard displaying the various cloud services available to your account.

    ![](images/Picture100-4.png)

- If your **Storage** cloud service are not visible, **click** on the **Customize Dashboard**, which will allow you to add services to the dashboard by clicking **Show.** For example, you can show the **Application Container, Developer and Storage** cloud services. If you do not want to see a specific service, click **Hide**

    ![](images/Picture100-5.png)

### Check/Set Storage Replication Policy

Depending on the state of your Cloud Account, you will need to set the **Replication Policy**, if it has not been previously set. In this step you will go to the Storage Cloud Service to check on the status of the Replicaton Policy. 

- Click on the **Storage** Cloud Service
    ![](images/Picture-01.png)

    ![](images/Picture-01.5.png)

- If the Replication Policy has not been set, use the default and click on the **Set Policy** button. If the message is not displayed, your replication policy has already been set, and your Cloud Account is ready for use.

    ![](images/Picture-02.5.png)

- Your Replication Policy is now set, and Services that require a Replication Policy will work correctly.
