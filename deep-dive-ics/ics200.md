---

## Introduction

This is the second of several labs that are part of the **ICS Deep dive** workshop. 

In this lab, you will learn how to create a basic 'hello world' echo service. 

Please direct comments to: John VanSant (john.vansant@oracle.com)

## Objectives

- Create your first mapping 

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

# Part 1: Create a REST Connection

In this first part of the lab, we will create a connection :

Letâ€™s start by logging into the Oracle Cloud account using your allocated user (demo.user1..10)  

**NOTE:** All the screenshots uses the _demo.user10_ account. 

## Creating Connection

### **STEP 1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud account

---

    ***NOTE:*** the **User Name and Password** values will be given to you by your instructor.
