- Learn how to test the ICS integration using SoapUI

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

## Part 1: Create the ICS Connections

### **1.1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud account

- If your identity domain is not already set, enter it and click **Go** (do not check to box to save it because this will set a cookie in the browser that needs to be cleared if you need to change identity domains later)  

    **NOTE:** the **Identity Domain** values will be given to you from your instructor.

- You will be presented with a Dashboard displaying the various cloud services available to this account.

   **NOTE:** The Cloud Services dashboard is intended to be used by the *Cloud Administrator* user role.  The Cloud Administrator is responsible for adding users, service instances, and monitoring usage of the Oracle cloud service account.  Developers and Operations roles will go directly to the service console link, not through the service dashboard.
