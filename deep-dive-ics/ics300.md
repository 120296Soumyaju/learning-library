# Lab 300 - Create an ICS Integration using a Database Adapter

---

## Introduction

This is the third of several labs that are part of the **ICS Development** workshop. 

In this lab, you develop an integration in ICS using a database adapter to query the Oracle EBS database.

In the previous lab, a REST connection was created.  In a similar manner we need to create the connections necessary for the integration in this lab which are for the inbound SOAP web service as well as the EBS Database.

The ICS integration that we'll be building is shown in the following picture:

![](images/300/image000.png)

Here is a description of what is happening with this integration:

SoapUI will be used to test the exposed Web Service endpoint of the ICS integration called *UserXX Create EBS Order* (where XX will be 00 -> 10).  This integration has 3 connections.  The incoming message is received by the incoming *UserXX SOAP* Soap Connection.  The *UserXX Create EBS Order* orchestration makes 2 queries into the EBS database using the *UserXX EBS DB APPS* connection to get details needed to create an order.  The orchestration finally uses the *UserXX EBS OPERATIONS* EBS Adapter connection for creating the order in EBS.  After the order is created in EBS, the Order Number is returned to the calling web service.

## Objectives

- Learn how to create ICS SOAP and Database Adapter Connections
- Learn how to create an ICS Orchestration using the ICS Adapters
- Learn how to test the ICS integration using SoapUI

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.
- SoapUI will need to be installed for ICS integration testing - see "Prerequisites" section of the workshop for details

## Part 1: Create the ICS Connections

### **1.1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud account

![](images/300/image031.png) 

## Part 2: Create the ICS Integration

---

### **2.1**: Create Orchestration Integration

**2.1.1** On the left-hand navigation of the Connections screen select the "Integrations" link

![](images/300/image032.png)

**2.1.2** Select the **New Integration** button in the top of the Integrations screen

![](images/300/image033.png)

**2.1.3** In the **Create Integration - Select a Style/Pattern**, select the **Orchestration** style.  We want to use this because our integration will have two invocations to the EBS Database and later another invocation to the EBS API to create an order - the **Basic Map Data** style only has a single target service invocation as well as additional invocations for data enrichment of the payload before the target invocation call is made.

![](images/300/image034.png)

**2.1.4** Fill in the information for the new orchestration

- **What triggers this integration?:** Select the radio button for `Application event or business object`.  Note that integrations can be scheduled to run at specific times if the `Schedule` trigger type is selected.
- **What do you want to call your integration?:** Enter the name in the form of _UserXX Create EBS Order_ where XX is the number in your allocated user.
- **Identifier:** Accept the default - this value will be generated based on the name you enter.
- **Version:** Accept the default - if you want to clone and create newer versions later, you can change to a higher version than **01.00.0000** which is the default.

After you've filled in the information, select the **Create** button

![](images/300/image035.png)

**2.1.5** Observe the design canvas for the new integration.  (The various features of the ICS designer were covered in lab 100 **Exploring ICS** earlier in this workshop)

![](images/300/image036.png)

**2.1.6** Create the Trigger for the orchestration. This integration will have a SOAP WSDL endpoint as defined when we created the **UserXX SOAP** connector earlier.

Expand the list of SOAP Triggers by clicking on the **SOAP(X)** link (where `X` will be the number of SOAP connections in the ICS instance - this will vary depending on how many others are running the workshop together).

Click and drag your SOAP connection identified by your assigned user (ie: `UserXX SOAP`) over to the **Start** target.  

(Note: After you click and start dragging your connection, the `Triggers` connection tray on the left hand side of the designer will become hidden)

![](images/300/image037.png)

**2.1.7** Drop your connection onto the large *Plus Sign* inside the *Start* circle.

![](images/300/image038.png)

**2.1.8** Give your trigger a name in the *Configure SOAP Endpoint -> Basic Info* dialog.

- **What do you want to call your endpoint?:** Enter the name `createOrder` as the trigger name.

After filling in the name, click on the **Next >** button

![](images/300/image039.png)

**2.1.9** Observe the SOAP operations/ports/objects in the *Configure SOAP Endpoint -> Operations* dialog.  These settings were all pulled from the WSDL which was uploaded in the configuration of the SOAP Connecter earlier.

After observing, click on the **Next >** button

![](images/300/image040.png)

**2.1.10** Review the settings for your new Trigger in the *Configure SOAP Endpoint -> Summary* dialog.

After reviewing, click on the **Done** button

![](images/300/image041.png)

**2.1.11** Observe that the orchestration's design pallette is populated with the Trigger _createOrder_ just created along with the mapping and return operations which will be used for the SOAP trigger's response payload.

![](images/300/image042.png)

**2.1.12** Save the progress of your orchestration by clicking on the **Save** icon in the upper right of the design window

![](images/300/image043.png)

### **2.2**: Create the Invocation for the First Database Connection

**2.2.1** Open the **INVOKES** connection tray by clicking on the `INVOKES` link in the very left of the orchestration design pallette so we can create the first call to the database.

![](images/300/image044.png)

**2.2.2** Select your database connector by clicking on the **Oracle Database(X)** link. (where `X` will be the number of Database connections in the ICS instance - this will vary depending on how many others are running the workshop together).
Click and drag your Database connection identified by your assigned user (ie: `UserXX EBS DB APPS`) over to the target which will be just below the `createOrder` trigger.

(Note: After you click and start dragging your connection, the `INVOKES` connection tray on the left hand side of the designer will become hidden)

![](images/300/image045.png)

**2.2.3** Drop your connection onto the large *Plus Sign* just below the `createOrder` trigger.

![](images/300/image046.png)

**2.2.4** Fill in the information for the new invoke in the *Oracle Adapter Endpoint Configuration Wizard* dialog.

- **What do you want to call your endpoint?:** Enter the name `getCustomerBillingInfo` as the service invocation name.
- **What operation do you want to perform?:** Select `Run a SQL Statement`.  The database adapter supports both calling database stored procedures as well as running ad-hoc SQL statements.

After filling in the basic information, click on the **Next >** button

![](images/300/image047.png)

**2.2.5** Copy the SQL statement provided with this workshop in the file `getCustomerBillToInfoQueryForICS.sql` which can be found in github relative to this lab here: [../artifacts/ics/getCustomerBillToInfoQueryForICS.sql](../artifacts/ics/getCustomerBillToInfoQueryForICS.sql) (copy this query to your copy buffer so it can be pasted into the ICS invoke configuration wizard).

Also, for your convenience, the SQL query to get the customer's bill to address ID is shown inline here:

`SELECT DISTINCT rc1.party_name,rc1.PARTY_ID,rc2.ACCOUNT_NUMBER,ra1.location_id,ra1.party_site_id,ra4.SITE_USE_ID FROM hz_parties rc1,hz_cust_accounts rc2,hz_party_sites ra1,hz_locations ra2,hz_cust_acct_sites_all ra3,hz_cust_site_uses_all ra4 WHERE rc2.party_id=rc1.party_id AND rc2.cust_account_id=ra3.cust_account_id AND ra3.party_site_id=ra1.party_site_id AND ra2.location_id=ra1.location_id AND ra3.cust_acct_site_id=ra4.cust_acct_site_id AND ra4.site_use_code='BILL_TO' AND rc2.status='A' AND ra3.status='A' AND upper(rc1.party_name) = #CUSTOMER AND RA3.BILL_TO_FLAG='P' AND ra3.SHIP_TO_FLAG='P' AND RA3.ORG_ID=204`

Note that the SQL query has to be in one line and doesn't end with a semi-colon.

Click on the **Validate SQL Query** button so the query can be validated for proper SQL syntax.

![](images/300/image048.png) 

**2.2.6** Verify that the SQL query was validated by the `Success!` message that will appear in the **Status** on the *Enter a SQL Query* dialog page.

If the query won't validate, then ensure you didn't paste in any funny characters or extra lines for the query.

Select the **Next >** button after you've validated the query has been successfully validated.

![](images/300/image049.png)

**2.2.7** Review the settings for your new adapter configuration in the *Oracle Adapter Endpoint Configuration Summary* dialog.

After reviewing, click on the **Done** button

![](images/300/image050.png)

**2.2.8** Observe that the orchestration's design pallette is populated with the invoke _getCustomerBillingInfo_ you just created along with the mapping needed to invoke this adapter.

Click on the **Zoom to Fit** button in the upper right of the design pallette if you want to see the entire orchestration.

![](images/300/image051.png)

**2.2.9** Click on the *mapping symbol* for the _getCustomerBillingInfo_ mapping - this will bring up 3 icons for activities we can do to the mapping.  

Click on the `pencil icon` to edit the mapping.

Note: You can also upload an external XSLT file for this mapping that you've created external to ICS if desired by clicking the little `upload` icon.  You can also delete the mapping with the little `trash can` icon.

![](images/300/image052.png)

**2.2.10** Edit the mapping by clicking on the little circle to the right of the `AccountName` source variable and then drag it on top of the little circle just to the left of the `CUSTOMER` target variable.

Note: As described in the lab 100 ICS overview, this map could be tested by selecting the **Test** button in the upper right.  We aren't going to test this mapping because it is so simple.

After completing the mapping, save it by clicking on the **Save** icon in the upper right of the design window

![](images/300/image053.png)

**2.2.11** Exit the mapping editor by clicking on the **< Exit Mapper** button in the upper left.

![](images/300/image054.png)

**2.2.12** Save the progress of your orchestration by clicking on the **Save** icon in the upper right of the design window

![](images/300/image055.png)

### **2.3**: Create the Invocation for the Second Database Connection

**2.3.1** Open the **INVOKES** connection tray by clicking on the `INVOKES` link in the very left of the orchestration design pallette so we can create the first call to the database.

Select your database connector by clicking on the **Oracle Database(X)** link. (where `X` will be the number of Database connections in the ICS instance - this will vary depending on how many others are running the workshop together).
Click and drag your Database connection identified by your assigned user (ie: `UserXX EBS DB APPS`) over to the target which will be just below the `createOrder` trigger.

Drag this second database invocation just below the `getCustomerBillingInfo` invocation.

(Note: After you click and start dragging your connection, the `INVOKES` connection tray on the left hand side of the designer will become hidden)

![](images/300/image056.png)

**2.3.2** Drop your connection onto the large *Plus Sign* just below the `getCustomerBillingInfo` service invocation.

![](images/300/image057.png)

**2.3.3** Fill in the information for the new invoke in the *Oracle Adapter Endpoint Configuration Wizard* dialog.

- **What do you want to call your endpoint?:** Enter the name `getCustomerShippingInfo` as the service invocation name.
- **What operation do you want to perform?:** Select `Run a SQL Statement`.  The database adapter supports both calling database stored procedures as well as running ad-hoc SQL statements.

After filling in the basic information, click on the **Next >** button

![](images/300/image058.png)

**2.3.4** Copy the SQL statement provided with this workshop in the file `getCustomerShipToInfoQueryForICS.sql` which can be found in github relative to this lab here: [../artifacts/ics/getCustomerShipToInfoQueryForICS.sql](../artifacts/ics/getCustomerShipToInfoQueryForICS.sql) (copy this query to your copy buffer so it can be pasted into the ICS invoke configuration wizard).

Also, for your convenience, the SQL query to get the customer's ship to address ID is shown inline here:

`SELECT DISTINCT rc1.party_name,rc1.PARTY_ID party_org_id,rc2.ACCOUNT_NUMBER,ra1.location_id,ra1.party_site_id,ra4.SITE_USE_ID FROM hz_parties rc1,hz_cust_accounts rc2,hz_party_sites ra1,hz_locations ra2,hz_cust_acct_sites_all ra3,hz_cust_site_uses_all ra4 WHERE rc2.party_id=rc1.party_id AND rc2.cust_account_id=ra3.cust_account_id AND ra3.party_site_id=ra1.party_site_id AND ra2.location_id=ra1.location_id AND ra3.cust_acct_site_id=ra4.cust_acct_site_id AND ra4.site_use_code='SHIP_TO' AND rc2.status='A' AND ra3.status='A' AND upper(rc1.party_name) = #CUSTOMER AND RA3.BILL_TO_FLAG='P' AND ra3.SHIP_TO_FLAG='P' AND RA3.ORG_ID=204`

Note that the SQL query has to be in one line and doesn't end with a semi-colon.

Click on the **Validate SQL Query** button so the query can be validated for proper SQL syntax.

![](images/300/image059.png) 

**2.3.5** Verify that the SQL query was validated by the `Success!` message that will appear in the **Status** on the *Enter a SQL Query* dialog page.

If the query won't validate, then ensure you didn't paste in any funny characters or extra lines for the query.

Select the **Next >** button after you've validated the query has been successfully validated.

![](images/300/image060.png)

**2.3.6** Review the settings for your new adapter configuration in the *Oracle Adapter Endpoint Configuration Summary* dialog.

After reviewing, click on the **Done** button

![](images/300/image061.png)

**2.3.7** Observe that the orchestration's design pallette is populated with the invoke _getCustomerShippingInfo_ you just created along with the mapping needed to invoke this adapter.

Click on the *mapping symbol* for the _getCustomerShippingInfo_ mapping.  

Click on the `pencil icon` to edit the mapping.

![](images/300/image062.png)

**2.3.8** Edit the mapping by clicking on the little circle to the right of the `AccountName` source variable and then drag it on top of the little circle just to the left of the `CUSTOMER` target variable.

After completing the mapping, save it by clicking on the **Save** icon in the upper right of the design window

![](images/300/image063.png)

**2.3.9** Exit the mapping editor by clicking on the **< Exit Mapper** button in the upper left.

**2.3.10** Save the progress of your orchestration by clicking on the **Save** icon in the upper right of the design window

![](images/300/image065.png)

### **2.4**: Create the Return Payload for the Integration

Note that the return payload is going to change in the next lab, lab 400, when we add a call to the EBS API to create an order.  The mapping of values in this lab will be done to verify the Billing and Shipping address IDs that were returned from the queries into the EBS database.

**2.4.1** Click on the *mapping symbol* for the _createOrder_ return payload mapping.  

Click on the `pencil icon` to edit the mapping.

![](images/300/image066.png)

**2.4.2** First, map the Billing address `PARTY_ID`

- In the Source variable section, click on the chevron to the left of the `getCustomerBillingInfoOutput` variable to expand it.
- Click on the little circle to the right of the `PARTY_ID` source variable and then drag it on top of the little circle just to the left of the `OrderNumber` target variable.

![](images/300/image070.png)

**2.4.3** We want to put an annotation in front of this variable in the return payload which says "Billing PARTY_ID = " so that it makes more sense with the `OrderNumber` target variable we are using for now.  In order do this, we will use the XSLT function `concat()`.

To open the advanced mapping editor, left-click on the target variable name's link `OrderNumber`.

![](images/300/image071.png)

**2.4.4** Scroll to bottom of the **Source** variables and then expand the `Mapping Components` section by clicking on the chevron just to the left of the label

![](images/300/image072.png)

**2.4.5** Access the XSLT `String` functions

- First expand the XSLT Functions by clicking on the chevron to the left of the `Functions` label
- Now expand the list of `String` functions by clicking on the chevron to the left of the `String` label

![](images/300/image073.png)

**2.4.6** Apply the `concat` function to the mapped variable.

- First click and drag the `concat` function in the list of XSLT String functions
- Drag the `concat` function on top of the mapped `PARTY_ID` variable
- Drop the `concat` function on top of the `<xsl:value-of select = ...` statement

![](images/300/image074.png)

**2.4.7** The advanced editor wants to know if the `PARTY_ID` variable should be the first or second argument to the concat function.

Click on the radio button for `string2`, then click on the **OK** button.

![](images/300/image075.png)

**2.4.8** Now we want to add the annotation string "Billing PARTY_ID = " as the first string in the concat function.

Click on `string` just beneath the concat function

![](images/300/image076.png)

**2.4.9** Type in the string `Billing PARTY_ID = ` in the editable textbox for the first argument for the concat function.

- After you have entered the string for the first concat argument, save this advanced mapping by selecting the **Save** button in the upper right.
- Finally, exit out of the advanced maping editor by clicking on the **Close** button in the lower right

![](images/300/image077.png)

**2.4.10** Now we will map the ID for the Shipping address into the return payload.

- In the Source variable section, click on the chevron to the left of the `getCustomerShippingInfoOutput` variable to expand it.
- Click on the little circle to the right of the `SITE_USE_ID` source variable and then drag it on top of the little circle just to the left of the `Status` target variable.

Just like with the Billing PARTY\\_ID variable, We want to put an annotation in front of this variable in the return payload which says "Billing PARTY\\_ID = " so that it makes more sense with the `Status` target variable we are using for now.  In order do this, we will use the XSLT function `concat()` again.

To open the advanced mapping editor, left-click on the target variable name's link `Status` to edit it.

**2.4.11** Like we did with the last advanced mapping, we want to put the string *Shipping SITE_USE_ID = * in front of that variable in the return payload.  Here are the steps to do that:

- Scroll to bottom of the **Source** variables and then expand the `Mapping Components` section by clicking on the chevron just to the left of the label
- Expand the XSLT Functions by clicking on the chevron to the left of the `Functions` label
- Now expand the list of `String` functions by clicking on the chevron to the left of the `String` label
- Now you can click and drag the `concat` function in the list of XSLT String functions
- Drag the `concat` function on top of the mapped `SITE_USE_ID` variable
- Drop the `concat` function on top of the `<xsl:value-of select = ...` statement
- Click on the radio button for `string2`, then click on the **OK** button.
- Click on `string` just beneath the concat function
- Type in the string `SHIPPING SITE_USE_ID = ` in the editable textbox for the first argument for the concat function.
- After you have entered the string for the first concat argument, save this advanced mapping by selecting the **Save** button in the upper right.
- Finally, exit out of the advanced maping editor by clicking on the **Close** button in the lower right

**2.4.12** The return payload mapping is now complete.

- Select the **Save** button in the upper right of the mapping editor.
- After saving, select the **< Exit Mapper** button in the upper left
