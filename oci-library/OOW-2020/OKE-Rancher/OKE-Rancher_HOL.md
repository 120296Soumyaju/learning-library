16. Click **+ Additional Selection** and select a different availability domain for the instance pool. Then, specify the VCN details for the second availability domain.

**We configured instances to be deployed in two different Avaialability domain though they can be deployed in the same Availability domain as long as service limits allow it.**

**For this lab use two different availability domains**

- **INITIAL NUMBER OF INSTANCES** : 1 (this is how many instances will be created in the instance pool initially)
- **SCALE-OUT OPERATOR** : Greater than (>)
- **THRESHOLD PERCENTAGE** : 10
- **NUMBER OF INSTANCES TO ADD** : 1
- **SCALE-IN OPERATOR** : Less than (<)
- **THRESHOLD PERCENTAGE** : 5
- **NUMBER OF INSTANCES TO REMOVE**  : 1

**Leave other fields as is**

20. Click **Create**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Configuring_Auto_Scaling/img/Auto_Scaling_005.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Configuring_Auto_Scaling/img/Auto_Scaling_006.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

**We have now created a auto scaling policy that will start with creating 1 compute instance in the designated pool. Once the CPU utilization is determined to be above 10% for at least 300 seconds another compute instance will be launched automatically. Once the CPU utilization is determined to be less than 5% for 300 seconds, one compute instance will be removed. At all times there will be at least 1 compute instance in the pool**

**Original image can be deleted as it's not part of the pool**

## Test the setup

1. Click **Instance Pools** under **Compute** and then your pool name. You should see a Compute instance created. Click the Compute Instance name.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Configuring_Auto_Scaling/img/Auto_Scaling_007.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

2. Note down the Public and Private IP of compute instance from the details page (Under **Primary VNIC Information** section). 

3. Open a web browser and enter load balancer's public IP address. You should see the message: `Web Server IP: <instance private IP>`

4. Switch to git bash window, if the ssh session to compute instance is still open then exit out of the session (quit command). 

5. Ensure you are in /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh directory.

6. Enter **ls** and verify id_rsa file exists

7. Enter command 
```
ssh -i id_rsa_user opc@<PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE>
```

**HINT:** If 'Permission denied error' is seen, ensure you are using '-i' in the ssh command

8. Enter 'Yes' when prompted for security message

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_Quick_Start/img/RESERVEDIP_HOL0014.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">
 
9. Now start CPU stress, Enter command:

```
sudo stress --cpu 4 --timeout 350
```

**Spawn 4 workers spinning on sqrt() with a timeout of 350 seconds.**

10. Switch back to OCI console and navigate to Instance pool details page. Click your instance name and scroll down to **Metric** screen, you should see CPU spiking up after a minute or so.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Configuring_Auto_Scaling/img/Auto_Scaling_009.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

11. Navigate to your Instance Pool details page. In about 3-4 minutes (time configured when we created auto scale configuration), status of Pool should change to **Scaling** and a second compute instance should launch.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Configuring_Auto_Scaling/img/Auto_Scaling_010.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

**This is since our criteria of CPU utilization > 10 was met**

12. When the second instance is up and running and the instance pool status is  'Running', switch to the web browser and refresh the page multiple times and observe the load balancer balancing traffic between the two web servers.

13. Switch back to git bash window and if the stress tool is still running, Prees Ctrl + C to stop the script.

14. Switch back to OCI console window and navigate to your compute instance details page. Verify CPU utilization goes down after a minute.

15. Navigate to Instanse pool details page and after 3-4 minute Instance pool status will change to **Scaling** . Additional compute instance will be deleted. 

**This is because our criteria of CPU utilization < 5 is met**

## Delete the resources

1. Switch to  OCI console window

2. If your Compute instance is not displayed, From OCI services menu Click **Instances** under **Compute**

3. Locate first compute instance, Click Action icon and then **Terminat** 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_Quick_Start/img/RESERVEDIP_HOL0016.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

4. Make sure Permanently delete the attached Boot Volume is checked, Click Terminate Instance. Wait for instance to fully Terminate

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_Quick_Start/img/RESERVEDIP_HOL0017.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

5. In OCI console window from Instance Pool Details page, Click **Terminate** under **Action**. Provide Instance Pool name in the pop up dialog box and Click **Terminate**. This will delete the pool along with the compute instance and auto scale configuration.
