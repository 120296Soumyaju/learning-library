# 

## Requirements for this lab

A deployed process 'Quote to Order' - see Required Environment Setup(TouchTheCloud000.md)

## Process Cloud Business Analytics

In this section we are going to configure the Quote to Order process to gather statics while in flight.

Each step identify the role, and what the user in the specific role try to achieve.

  Under the Reports section, you will see an entry for your report. The last step is to generate some information to be displayed in the report. To do this we have to start a couple of processes. See **Lab 200** **STEP 1 (Optional)** on a sample on how to create a couple of instances of your newly deployed application.

  Go ahead and create a couple of instances, and see how the report reflect the capture metrics in the process.
