## Introduction

This is the third of several labs that are part of the **Oracle Touch the Cloud** workshop. 

In this lab, you will acquire a good overview of the next generation Oracle Integration Cloud Service (aka ICS). You will modify an integration to Oracle EBS. You will explore various consoles and tools available to interact with your integration. The exercise will get your familiar with all the tooling available to work with this cloud service.

- You will be presented with a Dashboard displaying the various cloud services available to this account.

   **NOTE:** The Cloud Services dashboard is intended to be used by the *Cloud Administrator* user role.  The Cloud Administrator is responsible for adding users, service instances, and monitoring usage of the Oracle cloud service account.  Developers and Operations roles will go directly to the service console link, not through the service dashboard.
