# Lab 400 - Modify an ICS Integration by adding a EBS Adapter

---

## Introduction

This is the forth of several labs that are part of the **ICS Development** workshop. 

In this lab, you modify the integration that was create in Lab 300 using an EBS adapter to call an EBS API to create an Order using the EBS Order Management module..

The ICS integration that we'll be building is shown in the following picture:

Here is a description of what is happening with this integration:

SoapUI will be used to test the exposed Web Service endpoint of the ICS integration called *UserXX Create EBS Order* (where XX will be 00 -> 10).  This integration has 3 connections.  The incoming message is received by the incoming *UserXX SOAP* Soap Connection.  The *UserXX Create EBS Order* orchestration makes 2 queries into the EBS database using the *UserXX EBS DB APPS* connection to get details needed to create an order.  The orchestration finally uses the *UserXX EBS OPERATIONS* EBS Adapter connection for creating the order in EBS.  After the order is created in EBS, the Order Number is returned to the calling web service.

## Objectives

- Learn how to create ICS EBS Adapter Connections
- Learn how to modify an ICS Orchestration to use the new EBS Adapter
- Test the updated ICS integration using SoapUI

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.
- SoapUI will need to be installed for ICS integration testing - see "Prerequisites" section of the workshop for details

## Part 1: Modify the ICS Connections

### **1.1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud account
