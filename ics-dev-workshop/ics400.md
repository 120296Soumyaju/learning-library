# Lab 400 - Modify an ICS Integration by adding an EBS Adapter and API call

---

## Introduction

This is the forth of several labs that are part of the **ICS Development** workshop. 

In this lab, you modify the integration that was created in Lab 300 using the ICS EBS adapter to call an EBS API in order to create an Order in EBS using the Order Management module.

The ICS integration that we'll be building is shown in the following picture:

![](images/400/image000.png)

Here is a description of what is happening with this integration:

SoapUI will be used to test the exposed Web Service endpoint of the ICS integration called *UserXX Create EBS Order* (where XX will be 00 -> 10).  This integration has 3 connections.  The incoming message is received by the incoming *UserXX SOAP* Soap Connection.  The *UserXX Create EBS Order* orchestration makes 2 queries into the EBS database using the *UserXX EBS DB APPS* connection to get details needed to create an order.  The orchestration finally uses the *UserXX EBS OPERATIONS* EBS Adapter connection for creating the order in EBS.  After the order is created in EBS, the Order Number is returned to the calling web service.

## Objectives

- Learn how to create ICS EBS Adapter Connections
- Learn how to modify an ICS Orchestration to use the new EBS Adapter
- Test the updated ICS integration using SoapUI

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.
- An EBS instance and connection URL that will be provided by your instructor.
- Completion of the previous *Lab 300*
- SoapUI will need to be installed for ICS integration testing - see *Prerequisites* section of the workshop for details

## Part 1: Create the EBS Connection

### **1.1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud account

------

**1.1.1** From your browser (Firefox or Chrome recommended) go to the following URL:
<https://cloud.oracle.com>

**1.1.2** Click Sign In in the upper right hand corner of the browser
**IMPORTANT** - Under My Services, change Data Center to `US Commercial 2 (us2)` and click on Sign In to My Services

![](images/400/image006.png)

**1.2.11** Next, select the *Configure Agents* button so we can setup the association between this adapter and the ICS Connectivity Agent

![](images/400/image007.png)

**1.2.12** Click on the only agent group `EBS_AGENT_GROUP`, then select the *Use* button

![](images/400/image008.png)

**1.2.13** The connection needs to be tested by clicking on the *Test* button in the upper-right of the *UserXX EBS Operations* connection definition page

![](images/400/image009.png)

**1.2.14** Now, select the *Save* button to save the connection configuration.

![](images/400/image010.png)

**1.2.15** Note that after the successful test, the percentage complete in the upper-right should go to *100%*.  After the save, a green banner message will appear in the top indicating a successful save operation.

**1.2.16** Finally, select the *< Exit Connection* button to exit the connection configuration screen.

![](images/400/image011.png)

**1.2.17** You will now see your new **Oracle E-Business Suite** connection on top of the **Connections** list.

![](images/400/image012.png)

## Part 2: Modify the ICS Integration to Create an Order in EBS

In this second part of the lab, we will change the *UserXX Create EBS Order* ICS integration created in Lab 300 in order to use the EBS connection, just configured, to create an order in EBS.

### **2.1:** Open the ICS Design Console

---

**2.1.1** Select the `Designer` tab on top of the ICS Service Console to go to the `ICS Designer Portal`.

**2.1.2** Select the `Integrations` icon

   ![](images/400/image034.png)

### **2.2:** Deactivate and Open the Integration for Editing

---

**2.2.1** Click on the green slider switch on the right side of the *UserXX Create EBS Order* integration to initiate deactivation.  We need to deactivate the integration before we are able to edit it.

![](images/400/image013.png)

**2.2.2** Select *Deactivate* in order to deactivate the integration.

![](images/400/image014.png)

**2.2.3** Click on the orchestration name so that we can go to the integration editor.  In the image below `User03 Create EBS Order` is the hot-link to select.

![](images/400/image015.png)

### **2.3:** Add the Invocation to EBS to the Orchestration

---

**2.3.1** Select *Invoke* on the left-hand navigation in order to open up the list of connections that were configured to be the *Invoke* type

**2.3.2** Select *Oracle E-Business Suite* connector types then click on the connector you just created (in the picture below it is the `User03 EBS OPERATIONS` connector)

**2.3.3** Click and drag the connection just under the *getCustomerShippingInfo* invocation

(_Note that the connector tray will go away after you select your connector and start to drag it_)

![](images/400/image016.png)

**2.3.4** Drop the connection on top of the green plus sign landing zone which will appear just below the *getCustomerShippingInfo* invocation

![](images/400/image017.png)

**2.3.5** In the *Basic Info* section of the _Configure Oracle E-Business Suite Adapter Endpoint_ wizard, give the endpoint a name of `createEBSOrder`.

**2.3.6** After giving the invocation a name, select the *Next* button.

![](images/400/image018.png)

**2.3.7** In the *Web Services* section of the configuration wizard, for the *Product Family*, click on `=== Select ===` and then select `Order Management Suite`.  

(Note all the other EBS products for which APIs are available)

![](images/400/image019.png)

**2.3.8** Next, for the *Product*, click on `=== Select ===` and then select `Order Management`.  

(Note all the other EBS products for this suite which are available)

![](images/400/image020.png)

**2.3.9** Finally, for the *API*, scroll down and select the `Sales Order Services` API.  The *Internal Name* of `OE_INBOUND_INT` will automatically be populated.

**2.3.10** After selecting the API for the product family and product, select the *Next* button.

![](images/400/image021.png)

**2.3.11** In the *Operations* section of the configuration wizard, select the *Method* of `PROCESS_ORDER`, then select the *Next* button.

Note that the *Service Status* of `Ready to Use` indicates that the API has already been provisioned earlier from the EBS Integration Repository.

![](images/400/image022.png)

**2.3.12** In the *Summary* section of the configuration wizard, review the EBS API which is going to be used, then select the *Done* button.

![](images/400/image023.png)

**2.3.13** Observe that both the mapping and invocation to the EBS adapter now show up in the orchestration with the name `createEBSOrder`.

![](images/400/image024.png)

### **2.4:** Add Constant Variables for EBS Mapping

---

**2.4.1** Before we modify the mapping for the `PROCESS_ORDER` API, it's a good practice in ICS to create some variables in an *Assign* action to simplify the mapping process.  The variables can then also be reused across multiple API invocations if necessary.

**2.4.2** Click on the little house icon in the upper right of the designer in order to zoom into the top of the orchestration

![](images/400/image025.png)

**2.4.3** Select *Actions* on the left-hand navigation in order to open up the list of available orchestration actions.

**2.4.4** Click on *Assign* then drag the action just under the *createOrder* trigger.  We're putting it there because we want to define our constant variables at the start of the orchestration.

Note that the action tray will go away after you select your connector and start to drag it

![](images/400/image026.png)

**2.4.5** Drop the *Assign* action on top of the green plus sign landing zone which will appear just below the *createOrder* trigger

![](images/400/image027.png)

**2.4.6** Enter the *Name* of `initializeVariables` for this new assign action, then select the *OK* button.

![](images/400/image028.png)

**2.4.7** Enter the variable name `EBS_Responsibility` in the *Name* column just to right of the little trash can.

**2.4.8** Next, click on the little pencil icon on the very right of the variable definition table to bring up the expression editor.

![](images/400/image029.png)

**2.4.9** Enter the constant *Expression* of `"ORDER_MGMT_SUPER_USER"` (with double quotes), then hit the *Exit Expression Builder* button.

![](images/400/image030.png)

**2.4.10** A *Confirmation* dialog box will appear asking if you want to save your unsaved changes.  Select the *Yes* button.

![](images/400/image031.png)

**2.4.11** Select the little plus sign in the lower left of the variable table (just below to the little trash can) in order to add the next variable assignment.

![](images/400/image032.png)

**2.4.12** Enter the following variables into the assignment action one at a time following the procedure described in 2.4.7 -> 2.4.11:

<table border=2, border-width=2>
  <tr>
    <th  style="background-color: #008000">Variable Name</th>
    <th  style="background-color: #008000">Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>EBS_RespApplication</td><td>"ONT"</td></tr>
  <tr><td>EBS_SecurityGroup</td><td>"STANDARD"</td></tr>
  <tr><td>EBS_NLSLanguage</td><td>"AMERICAN"</td></tr>
  <tr><td>EBS_OrgID</td><td>"204"</td></tr>
  <tr><td>EBS_API_Version_Number</td><td>"1.0"</td></tr>
  <tr><td>EBS_Sold_From_Org_ID</td><td>"204"</td></tr>
  <tr><td>EBS_Price_List_ID</td><td>"1000"</td></tr>
  <tr><td>EBS_Order_Type_ID</td><td>"1430"</td></tr>
</table>

**2.4.13** After all the variables have been added to the assign action, select the *Exit Assignments* button.

![](images/400/image033.png)

### **2.5**	Map the **RESTHeader** and **InputParameters** Target Variables for the **createEBSOrder** API invocation

---

There are a total of 27 target variables that need to be mapped to successfully execute the EBS PROCESS_ORDER API call.  The next 4 sections will guide you through the process of mapping all these attributes.  Mapping many fields can be a common task while working with integrations.  ICS has the capability to do very complex mappings if necessary.

**2.5.1** The *createEBSOrder* mapping orchestration step is just above the corresponding *createEBSOrder* API invocation.

**2.5.2** Click on the double arrow mapping symbol to pop-up the edit pencil.

**2.5.3** Click on the little pencil to edit the mapping.

   ![](images/400/image035.png)

**2.5.4** Once the mapping editor is displayed, we can begin to map the constants we just previously created to the inbound payload for the EBS PROCESS_ORDER API

**2.5.5** We will first map the `Responsibility` target value.  Left-click and drag from the little circle just to the right of the `$EBS_Responsibility` variable in the Source variable list.

**2.5.6** Drop the `$EBS_Responsibility` on top of the little circle just to the left of the `Responsibility` variable in the Target on the right hand side of the mapping editor.

![](images/400/image036.png)

**2.5.7** Continue to map the first 6 constants according to the chart below

<table border=2, border-width=2>
  <tr>
    <th  style="background-color: #008000">Source Variable Name</th>
    <th  style="background-color: #008000">Target Variable Name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>$EBS_Responsibility</td><td>Responsibility</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$EBS_RespApplication</td><td>RespApplication</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$EBS_SecurityGroup</td><td>SecurityGroup</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$EBS_NLSLanguage</td><td>NLSLanguage</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$EBS_OrgID</td><td>Org_iD</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$EBS_API_Version_Number</td><td>P_API_Version_Number</td></tr>
</table>

![](images/400/image037.png)

**2.5.8** Now we need to set the value of 3 of the EBS target variables to *True* by giving them the hard-coded value of `T`.

**2.5.9** Left-click on the Target variable `P_INIT_MSG_LIST` in order to bring up the advanced mapping editor

![](images/400/image038.png)

**2.5.10** In the *Build Mappings* screen left-click on the field labeled *-- Drag and Drop or Type here...* to get into the edit mode

![](images/400/image039.png)

**2.5.11** Now type the constant letter `T` (with no quotes).

**2.5.12** After entering the value `T`, click on the *Save*, then *Close* buttons.

![](images/400/image040.png)

**2.5.13** Repeat steps 2.5.9 -> 2.5.12 for the following three target variables

<table border=2, border-width=2>
  <tr>
    <th style="background-color: #008000">Target Variable Name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>P_INIT_MSG_LIST</td></tr>
  <tr><td>P_RETURN_VALUES</td></tr>
  <tr><td>P_ACTION_COMMIT</td></tr>
</table>

**2.5.14** After setting the constant variables to `T`, expand the `P_HEADER_REC` variable so we can map the header record values

![](images/400/image041.png)

### **2.6** Map the **P\_HEADER\_REC** Target Variables for the **createEBSOrder** API invocation

---

**2.6.1** There are hundreds of attributes in the `P_HEADER_REC` so we will leverage the *Search* field to find the fields we need to map.

**2.6.2** Map the `createOrderRequest -> Comment` variable over to `P_HEADER_REC -> ATTRIBUTE1`.  Click and drag the little circle just to the right of the source `Comment` variable and then drag and drop it on top of the little circle just to the left of the `ATTRIBUTE1` target variable.

![](images/400/image057.png)

**2.6.3** Enter the target attribute name `CUST_PO_NUMBER` in the search field, then click on the search *magnifying glass*.  The `CUST_PO_NUMBER` field will be display on top of the target variable list.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Do not hit the search button for the variable more than once because it will go to the 2nd `CUST_PO_NUMBER` field which is in the next EBS payload section called `P_OLD_HEADER_REC`.

![](images/400/image042.png)

**2.6.4** We just need a number in the `CUST_PO_NUMBER` target field, so, even though it's not specificall for a PO#, map the source payload `ItemID` over as shown in the following screenshot to assign a number for that field.

![](images/400/image043.png)

**2.6.5** Next, we want to set the current date to the `ORDERED_DATE` header target variable.  Enter the target attribute name `ORDERED_DATE` in the search field, then click on the search *magnifying glass*.

**2.6.6** Click on the `ORDERED_DATE` header target variable to open up the advanced mapping editor.

![](images/400/image044.png)

**2.6.7** Scroll down and select `Mapping Components` on the bottom left of the *Source* side.

**2.6.8** Click and expand *Functions*, then click and expand *Date* functions.

**2.6.9** Drag and Drop the function `current-date` into the area labeled `-- Drag and Drop or Type here...`

![](images/400/image045.png)

**2.6.10** Select the *Save* and *Close* buttons

![](images/400/image046.png)

**2.6.11** Search for and set the following `P_HEADER_REC` values:

<table border=2, border-width=2>
  <tr>
    <th  style="background-color: #008000">Source Value</th>
    <th  style="background-color: #008000">Target Variable Name in P_HEADER_REC</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>$EBS_Order_Type_ID</td><td>ORDER_TYPE_ID</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$EBS_Sold_From_Org_ID</td><td>SOLD_FROM_ORG_ID</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$getCustomerBillingInfo -> getCustomerBillingInfoOutputCollection -> getCustomerBillingInfoOutput -> PARTY_ID</td><td>SOLD_TO_ORG_ID</td></tr>
  <tr><td>constant: <em>USD</em> (no quotes)</td><td>TRANSACTIONAL_CURR_CODE</td></tr>
  <tr><td>constant: <em>CREATE</em> (no quotes)</td><td>OPERATION</td></tr>
</table>

**2.6.12** We have mapped a lot of values and it's difficult to see what has been accomplished on the Target side because we were using the *Search* feature.  In order to make it easy to see what has been mapped, we will apply a *Filter* to the target variable side.

**2.6.13** Click on the *Filter* button on the *Target* side of the mapping editor.

**2.6.14** In the *Filter* dialog box in the *Is it Mapped?* section, select the radio button `Mapped`, then select the *Apply* button.

![](images/400/image047.png)

**2.6.15** You will now have a good view of all the currently mapped fields in the *RESTHeader*, *InputParameters*, and *P_HEADER_REC* target variable sections.

**2.6.16** Compare your work to the screenshot below:

![](images/400/image048.png)

**2.6.17** It is a good practice to occasionally save your work during a long mapping exercise.  Click on the *Save* button in the upper right of the mapper to save your work up to this point.

### **2.7** Map the **P\_LINE\_TBL** Target Variables for the **createEBSOrder** API invocation

---

**2.7.1** There are still 11 target fields left to map. 

**2.7.2** We need to remove the target filter so we can find the final fields to map.  Click on the *Filter* button on the *Target* side of the mapping editor.

**2.7.3** In the *Filter* dialog box in the *Is it Mapped?* section, select the radio button `All Fields`, then select the *Apply* button.

![](images/400/image049.png)

**2.7.4** In the *Search* field on the target side, enter the string `P_LINE_TBL`, then click on the little magnifying glass icon.

**2.7.5** Expand the `P_LINE_TBL` target node by clicking on the little chevron just to the left of the variable.

**2.7.6** Map the source `createOrderRequest -> Lines` variable over to the `P_LINE_TBL_ITEM` target variable.  A *for-each(Lines)* XSLT expression is automatically added for this mapping because both the source *Lines* and the target *P_LINE_TBL_ITEM* are both arrays because there can be more than one line item in an order.

![](images/400/image050.png)

**2.7.7** Expand the `P_LINE_TBL_ITEM` node, the enter `INVENTORY_ITEM_ID` in the target Search box then hit the search button (magnifying glass).

**2.7.8** Map the source variable `ItemID` over to the target `INVENTORY_ITEM_ID` as shown below.

![](images/400/image051.png)

**2.7.9** Continue to map the following source values into the `P_LINE_TBL_ITEM` target variables as shown in the following table:

(Note: You can continue to use the search box or just scroll down - the target variables are in alphebetical order)

<table border=2, border-width=2>
  <tr>
    <th  style="background-color: #008000">Source Value</th>
    <th  style="background-color: #008000">Target Variable Name in P_LINE_TBL_ITEM</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>createOrderRequest -> ItemID</td><td>INVENTORY_ITEM_ID</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$getCustomerBillingInfo -> getCustomerBillingInfoOutputCollection -> getCustomerBillingInfoOutput -> SITE_USE_ID</td><td>INVOICE_TO_ORG_ID</td></tr>
  <tr><td>createOrderRequest -> Qty</td><td>ORDERED_QUANTITY</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$EBS_Price_List_ID</td><td>PRICE_LIST_ID</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Mapping Components -> Functions -> Date -> current-date()</td><td>PRICING_DATE</td></tr>
  <tr><td>constant: <em>204</em> (no quotes)</td><td>SHIP_FROM_ORG_ID</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$getCustomerShipToInfo -> getCustomerShipToOutputCollection -> getCustomerShipToInfoOutput -> SITE_USE_ID</td><td>SHIP_TO_ORG_ID</td></tr>
  <tr><td>createOrderRequest -> Price</td><td>UNIT_SELLING_PRICE</td></tr>
  <tr><td>constant: <em>CREATE</em> (no quotes)</td><td>OPERATION</td></tr>
  <tr><td>constant: <em>N</em> (no quotes)</td><td>CALCULATE_PRICE_FLAG</td></tr>
</table>

**2.7.10** Once again, we have mapped a lot of values and it's difficult to see what has been accomplished on the Target side because we were using the *Search* feature.  In order to make it easy to see what has been mapped, we will apply a *Filter* to the target variable side.

**2.7.11** Click on the *Filter* button on the *Target* side of the mapping editor.

**2.7.12** In the *Filter* dialog box in the *Is it Mapped?* section, select the radio button `Mapped`, then select the *Apply* button.

![](images/400/image047.png)

**2.7.13** You will now have a good view of all the currently mapped fields in the *RESTHeader*, *InputParameters*, and *P_HEADER_REC* target variable sections.

**2.7.14** Compare your work to the screenshot below:

![](images/400/image052.png)

**2.7.15** It is a good practice to occasionally save your work during a long mapping exercise.  Click on the *Save* button in the upper right of the mapper to save your work up to this point.

### **2.8:** Test the Updated Mapping

---

**2.8.1** ICS has a built-in test harness so that you can see if the changes you made to your mapping actually work.

**2.8.2** First, select the *Test* button just below the *Save* button just pressed.

   ![](images/400/image053.png)

**2.8.3** Next, select the `Generate Inputs` button in the upper-right of the testing window.

   ![](images/400/image054.png)

**2.8.4** We want to put an interesting comment in the input `<ns0:Comment>` element in the `Input: createOrderRequest` incoming payload.

**2.8.5** Edit the data in the generated inbound payload to something custom.  In this example it was set to *This is my Comment!*

   ![](images/400/image055.png)

**2.8.6** Now that the input data is ready, select the `Execute` button in the upper-right of the test window.

   ![](images/400/image056.png)

**2.8.7** The mapping will be applied to the generated input data and the result will be shown in the `Output: PROCESS_ORDER_Input` section on the right side of the test window.

**2.8.8** Look for your custom comment and note that it has been mapped to the `P_HEADER_REC` -> `ATTRIBUTE1` element.

**2.8.9** Now that we have seen that our mapping has been successfully modified, we can close the test window. Select the `Close` button in the lower-right of the test window.

   ![](images/400/image058.png)

**2.8.10** Now we can close the Mapping Editor because our changes have been made and tested.

**2.8.11** Click on the `Exit Mapper` button in the upper-left of the Mapping Editor.

   ![](images/400/image059.png)

**2.8.12** Save your changes made to the integration by pushing the `Save` button in the upper-right of the integration.

### **2.9:** Remap the Return Payload

---

In Lab 300, we used a temporary mapping of the return values to verify the output of the 2 queries to the EBS database.  In this section we will remap those to the final configuration.

**2.9.1** Scroll down to the bottom of the orchestration and open up the *createOrder* mapping action.

![](images/400/image061.png)

**2.9.2** We need to delete the previous mappings from Lab 300.  Right-click on the target `OrderNumber` variable to pop-up the *Delete Mapping* menu.  

(Note: If the menu doesn't pop-up on the first right-click, try it again and it should appear)

![](images/400/image062.png)

**2.9.3** Select *Yes* from the pop-up dialog that asks if you're sure you want to delete this mapping?

![](images/400/image063.png)

**2.9.4** In the mapping editor, scroll the bottom of the Source variables and then expand the `$createEBSOrder -> PROCESS_ORDERResponse -> OutputParameters` variable by clicking on the little chevron just to the left of the variable.

**2.9.5** After expanding the `OutputParameters`, then expand the `X_MESSAGES` source variable and then the `X_MESSAGES_ITEM` variable.

**2.9.6** Click and drag the `X_MESSAGES_ITEM` source variable over to the target `ErrorMsgs -> Message` variable.

![](images/400/image064.png)

**2.9.7** Click and drag the source variable `X_RETURN_STATUS` over to the target `Status` variable

![](images/400/image065.png)

**2.9.8** Next, expand the source variable `X_HEADER_REC`, then in the search box on the source side, enter the string `ORDER_NUMBER` then select the search button (little magnifying glass)

![](images/400/image066.png)

**2.9.9** Map the `ORDER_NUMBER` source variable over to the `OrderNumber` target variable.

![](images/400/image067.png)

**2.9.10** Click on the *Save* button in the upper right of the mapping editor.

**2.9.10** Now, click on the *Exit Mapper* button in the upper left of the mapping editor.

![](images/400/image068.png)

**2.9.11** From the orchestration, select the *Save* button to save all the changes made to the final mapping for the return payload.

**2.9.12** Finally, select the *Exit Integration* button in the upper left of the orchestration designer.

![](images/400/image069.png)

### **2.10:** Activate Changes to the Integration

---

**2.10.1** Click on the *Activate* switch/slider on the right of the `UserXX Create EBS Order` integration.

   ![](images/400/image070.png)

**2.10.2** The `Activate Integration?` dialog will be displayed

**2.10.3** Select the *Enable tracing* button since this isn’t a production deployment.  This checkbox will tell ICS that the payloads for each instance of the integration will be saved in the logfiles as explored in the first part of this lab earlier.

**2.10.4** Now select the *Activate* button to begin activation of the integration.

   ![](images/400/image071.png)

**2.10.5** Once the integration is activated you will see that the activation slider now is colored green with a checkmark in it.

**2.10.6** A message will appear on the top of the ICS Designer Portal indicating that the integration activation was successful.  The WSDL for the service endpoint will also be displayed.

   ![](images/400/image072.png)

### **2.11:**	Check the Service Endpoint

---

**2.11.1** Click on the WSDL link so we can ensure that this integration has an available service endpoint.

   ![](images/400/image073.png)

**2.11.2** The WSDL for you new ICS integration will now be displayed in your browser.

**2.11.3** Copy the WSDL URL into your copy buffer so we can test it in the next lab section.

   ![](images/400/image074.png)

**2.11.4** Now that we have built and activated an integration and copied it's service endpoint, we can test it with some sample data to make sure it works.

## Part 3: Test the ICS Integration

---

### **3.1**: Test Using SoapUI

**3.1** Open SoapUI.  If you don't already have this installed, follow the instructions provided in the **Prerequisites** section of this workshop.

![](images/200/image052.png)

**3.2** Click on the **SOAP** button so we can create a new project for testing our new ICS SOAP Web Service

![](images/300/image089.png)

**3.3** In the **New SOAP Project** dialog window, paste the WSDL URL into the **Initial WSDL** window and give a meaningful **Project Name** such as _User03 Create EBS Order_.  Keep the checkbox selected for **create sample requests for all operations?**.  Click on the **OK** button after you've initialized the settings for your new SoapUI SOAP project.

![](images/300/image090.png)

**3.4** The new SOAP Project will appear in the left-hand navigation.

**3.5** Expand the **createOrder** operation by clicking on it, then open the auto-generated sample request **Request 1** by double-clicking on it.  An empty request payload will be generated.

![](images/300/image091.png)

**3.6** In the request payload, replace the question marks with the following test values:

- **AccountName**: _A. C. Networks_
- **Comment**: _Lab 300 request from SoapUI_
- **ItemID**: _2155_
- **Qty**: _1_
- **Price**: _3333_

![](images/300/image092.png)

**3.7** Next we need to add the authorization credentials so ICS will allow the request from SoapUI.  ICS uses basic username/password authentication.

**3.8** Click on the **Auth** button in the lower-left of the **Request 1** SoapUI window

**3.9** In the **Authorization** dropdown, select _Add New Authorization..._

![](images/300/image093.png)

**3.10** In the **Add Authorization** dialog pop-up window, select **Type** of _Basic_ form the picklist, then select the **OK** button.

![](images/300/image094.png)

**3.11** Fill in your assigned username and password in the **Auth (Basic)** window at the bottom of the SoapUI request window

![](images/300/image095.png)

**3.12** ICS needs two headers in the request payload to satisfy the enforced Web Services Security (WSS) standards.  It needs both the **WSS Username Token** and the **WS-Timestamp**.

**3.13** Insert the **WSS Username Token** by right-clicking in the Request payload body and select **Add WSS Username Token** from the pull-down list

![](images/300/image096.png)

**3.14** In the **Specify Password Type** dialog pop-up window, select _PasswordText_ as the WSS Username Token type, then click on the **OK** button.

![](images/300/image097.png)

**3.15** Insert the **WS-Timestamp** by right-clicking in the Request payload body and select **Add WS-Timestamp** from the pull-down list

![](images/300/image098.png)

**3.16** In the **Specify Time-To-Live value** dialog pop-up window, set the value (in milliseconds) to _60000_ (60 seconds), then click on the **OK** button.

![](images/300/image099.png)

**3.17** Finally your request payload is ready to send to ICS.

**3.18** Click on the green _Submit Request_ arrow in the upper left of the **Request 1** window.

![](images/300/image100.png)

**3.19** The right side of the **Request 1** SoapUI window will display the results of the ICS integration call.

**3.20** The return payload of the ICS integration will show both the _Billing PARTY_ID = XX_ and _Shipping SITE_USE_ID = YY_ values which were looked up in the two EBS Database calls.

![](images/300/image109.png)

You have now completed Lab 300 of the ICS Developer Workshop.  In the next lab, we will modify the orchestration we just created by adding a call to an EBS API using the EBS Adapter.
