# Lab 400 - Modify an ICS Integration by adding an EBS Adapter and API call

---

## Introduction

This is the forth of several labs that are part of the **ICS Development** workshop. 

In this lab, you modify the integration that was created in Lab 300 using the ICS EBS adapter to call an EBS API in order to create an Order in EBS using the Order Management module.

The ICS integration that we'll be building is shown in the following picture:

![](images/400/image000.png)

Here is a description of what is happening with this integration:

SoapUI will be used to test the exposed Web Service endpoint of the ICS integration called *UserXX Create EBS Order* (where XX will be 00 -> 10).  This integration has 3 connections.  The incoming message is received by the incoming *UserXX SOAP* Soap Connection.  The *UserXX Create EBS Order* orchestration makes 2 queries into the EBS database using the *UserXX EBS DB APPS* connection to get details needed to create an order.  The orchestration finally uses the *UserXX EBS OPERATIONS* EBS Adapter connection for creating the order in EBS.  After the order is created in EBS, the Order Number is returned to the calling web service.

## Objectives

- Learn how to create ICS EBS Adapter Connections
- Learn how to modify an ICS Orchestration to use the new EBS Adapter
- Test the updated ICS integration using SoapUI

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.
- An EBS instance and connection URL that will be provided by your instructor.
- Completion of the previous *Lab 300*
- SoapUI will need to be installed for ICS integration testing - see *Prerequisites* section of the workshop for details

## Part 1: Create the EBS Connection

### **1.1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud account

------

**1.1.1** From your browser (Firefox or Chrome recommended) go to the following URL:
<https://cloud.oracle.com>

**1.1.2** Click Sign In in the upper right hand corner of the browser
**IMPORTANT** - Under My Services, change Data Center to `US Commercial 2 (us2)` and click on Sign In to My Services

**1.1.3** If your identity domain is not already set, enter it and click *Go*

**NOTE:** the *Identity Domain* values will be given to you from your instructor.

**1.1.4** Once your Identity Domain is set, enter your `User Name` and `Password` and click *Sign In*

***NOTE:*** the *User Name and Password* values will be given to you by your instructor.

**1.1.5** You will be presented with a Dashboard displaying the various cloud services available to this account.

**NOTE:** The Cloud Services dashboard is intended to be used by the *Cloud Administrator* user role.  The Cloud Administrator is responsible for adding users, service instances, and monitoring usage of the Oracle cloud service account.  Developers and Operations roles will go directly to the service console link, not through the service dashboard.

### **1.2**: Create the EBS Connector

---

**1.2.1** Select the `Connections` graphic in the designer portal

![](images/300/image005.png) 

**1.2.2** Click on *New Connection*

![](images/300/image006.png) 

**1.2.3** Select the *Oracle E-Business Suite* Connection, by either doing a search, or by scrolling down to the *Oracle E-Business Suite* connection, then click on the *Select* button of the *Oracle E-Business Suite* connection.

![](images/400/image001.png)

**1.2.4** Fill in the information for the new connection 

- *Name:* Enter in the form of _UserXX EBS OPERATIONS_ where XX is the number in your allocated user.
- *Role:* Select _Invoke_ since we going to use the connection to invoke APIs from EBS

Note that the *Identifier* will automatically be created based on the *Name* you entered.

**1.2.5** Click *Create*

**1.2.6** Click the *Configure Connectivity* button

![](images/400/image003.png)

**1.2.7** Enter the *Connection URL* which you will be given by your instructor.  It will be in format like the following: `https://ucf4-ebs0116-gse.oracledemos.com`.

**1.2.8** After entering the *Connection URL*, select the *OK* button to save the value.

- *Username*: `operations`
- *Password*: `welcome`

After the security policy properties have been setup, click on the *OK* button to dismiss the dialog

![](images/400/image006.png)

**1.2.11** Next, select the *Configure Agents* button so we can setup the association between this adapter and the ICS Connectivity Agent

![](images/400/image007.png)

**1.2.12** Click on the only agent group `EBS_AGENT_GROUP`, then select the *Use* button

![](images/400/image008.png)

**1.2.13** The connection needs to be tested by clicking on the *Test* button in the upper-right of the *UserXX EBS Operations* connection definition page

![](images/400/image009.png)

**1.2.14** Now, select the *Save* button to save the connection configuration.

![](images/400/image010.png)

**1.2.15** Note that after the successful test, the percentage complete in the upper-right should go to *100%*.  After the save, a green banner message will appear in the top indicating a successful save operation.

**1.2.16** Finally, select the *< Exit Connection* to exit the connection configuration screen.
