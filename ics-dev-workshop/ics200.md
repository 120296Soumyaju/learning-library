# Lab 200 - Integration Cloud Service

## Introduction

This is the second of several labs that are part of the **ICS Development Workshop**. 

In this lab, you will learn how to create a basic 'hello world' echo service, using a basic orchestration. 

Please direct comments to: John VanSant (john.vansant@oracle.com)

## Objectives

- Create your first integration to echo an input to the output 

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

# Login to your Oracle Cloud account

>***NOTE:*** the **User Name and Password** values will be given to you by your instructor.

- You will be presented with the ICS home page. 

# Part 1: Create a REST Connection
----

In this first part of the lab, we will create a connection :

Letâ€™s start by logging into the Oracle Cloud account using your allocated user (demo.user1..10)  

>**NOTE:** All the screenshots uses the _demo.user10_ account. Replace the _demo.user10_ with your assigned account to validate the steps illustrated in in the screebshots.

**2.4** Fill in the information for the new connection 

- **Name** in the form of _UserXX REST_ where XX is the number in your allocated user.
- **Role** _Trigger_ since we going to use the connection as a trigger to start the integration
